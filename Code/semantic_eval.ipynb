BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Such differential pressure sensors are counted as belonging to the state of the art and are formed of a semiconductor substrate which in an inner region is thinned out into a membrane. Four measurement resistances are formed in this inner region, which are connected into a measurement bridge so that on deformation of the membrane, as occurs when impinged by pressure, the pressure acting on both sides of the membrane may be determined in the form of a differential pressure whilst making use of the piezoresistive effect. Differential pressure sensors as well as simple pressure sensors with which atmospheric pressure prevails on one side function according to this principle. Such a semiconductor pressure sensor is known for example from DE 197 01 055 A1. Since the characteristic curve of the pressure sensor changes due to temperature, it is counted as belonging to the state of the art, apart from the actual measurement resistances formed on the membrane, to arrange so-called compensation resistances in the region next to the membrane which are dimensioned such that their piezoresistive coefficients are equal with regard to magnitude. The resistances are connected in series and are arranged such that their changes due to temperature are compensated. From EP 0 083 496 B1 it is counted as belonging to the state of the art to arrange the measurement resistances and compensation resistances in each case parallel to one another and to connect these into measurement bridges, in order in this manner to compensate measurement errors caused by temperature. Furthermore measurement differences due to the pressure level are here too compensated by the circuit arrangement. However with the arrangement known from EP 0 083 496 B1 the compensation resistances lie outside the membrane region, and specifically where the semiconductor substrate is to be regarded as practically rigid due to a glass tube attached perpendicularly thereto. The sensor known from DE 197 01 055 A1 as well as from EP 0 083 496 B1 may be applied as a differential pressure sensor, but however in practice is provided for a pressure measurement with respect to the atmospheric pressure acting on the membrane on one side, and thus are not suitable for measuring a differential pressure deviating from this. For controlling heating circulatory pumps it is counted as belonging to the state of the art to apply a differential pressure senor in the heating circuit in order in this manner to detect the load condition of the heating installation and to control the heating circulatory pump accordingly. At the same time the differential pressure is a measure for the setting of the thermostat valves and thus for the heat requirement of the installation. The system pressure prevailing in the region of the pump differs very considerably depending on the position of installation and the design of the heating, even though the differential pressures lie roughly at the same level. It is particularly desirable in the previously mention case of application, apart from the differential pressure to detect a system pressure, since this provides information on the extent of filling of the heating installation, so that one may prevent the pump from running dry. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore the object of the present invention to design a differential pressure sensor of the known type such that one may detect a further differential pressure as simply as possible, in particular such that a detection of the absolute pressure is possible, thus a detection of pressure with respect to the ambient pressure. This object is achieved according to the invention with a differential pressure sensor, with a carrier which in an inner region comprises a membrane which may be impinged by pressure on both sides. Measurement resistances, provided for detecting the differential pressure acting on the membrane, are formed within the membrane. Compensation resistances are formed on the carrier. The compensation resistances are connected to the measurement resistances and the measurement resistances are connected into a first measurement bridge and the compensation resistances into a second measurement bridge. Differential pressure determination means are provided to determine the differential pressure of the pressure acting on one side of the membrane and of a pressure acting on an end-face of the carrier, by way of the voltage prevailing at the second measurement bridge. The basic concept of the invention, with a differential pressure sensor of the known type, is to use the voltage signal prevailing at the second measurement bridge in order to determine the pressure acting on one side of the membrane in relation to the pressure acting on an end-face of the carrier, for example the atmospheric pressure. The differential pressure sensor according to the invention consists of a carrier in whose inner region a membrane is arranged which may be impinged by pressure on both sides. The carrier is advantageously formed by a semiconductor substrate which is thinned out into a membrane in an inner region. Measurement resistances for detecting the differential pressure acting on the membrane are provided within the membrane. Furthermore compensation resistances which are connected to the measurement resistances are formed on the carrier or semiconductor substrate, wherein the measurement resistances are connected into a first measurement bridge and the compensation resistances into a second measurement bridge. By way of the voltage prevailing at the second measurement bridge as well as the voltage prevailing at the first measurement bridge, according to the invention on the one hand the differential pressure on both sides of the membrane is determined and on the other hand the differential pressure between one side of the membrane and an end-face of the carrier or the semiconductor substrate is determined. So that the carrier or the semiconductor substrate may deform as freely as possible according to the acting pressures, it is useful to fix this elastically on both sides, preferably by way of two O-rings which simultaneously ensure the sealing. In order to be able to measure the absolute pressure which acts on one side of the membrane it is necessary to impinge the semiconductor substrate at least on one side with ambient pressure. This according to the invention may advantageously be effected outside the fixation, preferably on an end-face of the substrate. Suitable surface cross sections transverse to the deflection direction of the membrane result by way of this, on which on the one side the absolute pressure to be measured acts and on the other side the ambient pressure. With the differential pressure sensor according to the invention, the compensation resistances may either be arranged next to the membrane but within the fixation as is also known from the state of the art. According to the invention however, the compensation resistances may also be arranged on the membrane itself. By way of this the fixation of the substrate may be effected closer to the membrane which leads to a greater measurement accuracy with low system pressures, and to a small constructional size. In a further formation of the invention it is further envisaged to not only provide the compensation resistances outside the membrane, but also outside the fixation, thus to provide them where only the atmospheric pressure acts and not one of the pressures from which the differential pressure is to be determined. The evaluation of the absolute pressure according to the invention is effected by way of the second measurement bridge which is formed of compensation resistances. For measurement, the measurement resistances of the differential pressure sensor located on the membrane may in turn serve as compensation resistances, for example in order to compensate the temperature-dependent zero (null) drift as is specified further below in equation (2) in the last two terms by way of the pressure Pd. According to the invention the absolute pressure is sensorically detected by way of the compensation resistances of the differential pressure sensor. In order to process a corresponding voltage signal or signals and to convert this or these into a signal which controls a display which displays the absolute pressure, according to the invention an electronic circuit is provided which is fed by the output voltages and which has a data output or a connection for an absolute pressure display. Such an electronic circuit may typically be a microprocessor. The data output is then usefully a digital one for controlling a corresponding digital display or for transmitting the data to a computer. With the application of such a differential pressure sensor in a heating circulatory pump which is controlled by a frequency converter, the microprocessor which is present in any case on the frequency converter side may be used for this task in a particularly economical manner. Alternatively, according to the invention the voltages prevailing at the measurement bridges may also be processed by way of a comparatively inexpensive analog circuit whose output delivers a voltage signal which controls an analog display, typically a pointer instrument. According to the invention, advantageously the absolute pressure is detected on that side of the substrate on which this is thinned out for forming the membrane. The substrate is an essentially two-dimensional component of a comparatively low thickness. In order to be able to realize in particular the absolute pressure measurement according to the invention, in a manner which is simple with regard to measurement technology, it is useful to select the ratio between the substrate surface area and the membrane surface area between 3 and 30, preferably in the region of about 16. The thickness ratios between the substrate and the thinned out region of the membrane is also significant, in particular for the absolute pressure measurement. Here one preferably selects a thickness ratio between the thickness of the substrate and the thickness of the membrane which is between 10 and 200, preferably about 25. The measurement range or the measurement accuracy of the differential pressure sensor according to the invention, in particular with regard to the differential pressure which is also to be determined, may be increased by way of profiling the membrane or by designing it with a differing thickness. The differential pressure sensor according to the invention in particular is advantageously integrated in a heating circulatory pump unit, but may also be used in other applications where the differential pressure prevailing between two fluids, as well as on one side, an absolute pressure with respect to the atmospheric pressure or a third pressure (not atmospheric pressure) is to be determined. The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated.\",\n          \"FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN) and more precisely to a Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) method in a multi-RAT cellular telephone network. For the aim of the following disclosure a list of the most relevant acronyms and a brief functional description is included in APPENDIX 6. BACKGROUND ART With the introduction of 3rd Generation UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) systems the multi-RAT (Radio Access Technology) opportunities will be put in foreground. The former 2rd Generation PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) includes: GSM 900 MHz, DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System), GSM EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service); PCS (Personal Communication System), etc. In the new 3rd Generation UMTS two CDMA radio access techniques have been defined, respectively known as: TDD (Time Division Duplex) UTRA (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access), in which transmission directions are distinguished in the time domain, and FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) UTRA, in which transmission directions are distinguished in the frequency domain. The FDD UTRA is used by the WCDMA (Wide band Code Division Multiple Access) system. The TDD UTRA technique foresees in its turn two options: HCR (High Chip Rate) TDD at 3.84 Mcps, and LCR (Low Chip Rate) TDD at 1.28 Mcps. The Applicant and CWTS (Chinese Wireless Telecommunication Standards) committee are furthermore engaged in the development of a TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access), standard which is based on the 3GPP 1.28 Mcps TDD physical layer and on the reuse of the GSM-GPRS higher layer functions and procedures, offering the operators a technology able to run on most of the deployed GSM network elements. Both 2nd and 3rd Generation PLMNs are standardized by international authorities whose aim is that of making the operation of the systems of the various manufacturers each other compatible. In particular, GSM had been described in the relevant Technical Reports (TR) issued by the Special Mobile Group (SMG) of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), while UMTS is described in the Technical Specifications (TS) issued by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in the ambit of the ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union). At the time of writing, the SMG does not exist anymore and the related GSM work has been taken over by 3GPP that incorporate standardisation of both GSM and UMTS systems. FIG. 1 shows a multi-RAT (Radio Access Technology) PLMN that will be soon completed in Europe. The new Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) shares the existing GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) Core Network CN with the GPRS service. Relevant GSM RAN (Radio Access Network) in FIG. 1 is the so-called GERAN (GSM EDGE RAN), corresponding to the ultimate GSM RAN based on new EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) techniques that allow higher data rates in GSM, e.g. higher modulations. The Core Network CN is connected to one or more BSS (Base Station Subsystem) of the GSM, and to one or more RNS (Radio Network Subsystem) of an UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network). The UMTS system of FIG. 1 is described in the TS 23.002 (CN) and TS 25.401 (UTRAN). Both the UTRAN and BSS are connected, on air, to a plurality of User Equipment UE/MS, each including a Mobile Equipment ME with a respective USIM card (UMTS Subscriber Identity Module). The present invention applies to UEs of single but preferably multistandard type: so that they are indicated as UE/MS (without limitation, often the only term UE is indicated). The UTRAN includes a plurality of Node B blocks each connected to a respective Radio Network Controller RNC by means of an Iub interface. A node B includes a Base Transceiver Station BTS connected to the UEs through an on-air Uu interface. The upper RNC is a Serving S-RNC connected to the Core Network CN by means of a first Iu(CS) interface for Circuits Switched and a second Iu(PS) interface for Packet Switched of the GPRS. It is also connected to an Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC). The RNC placed below can be a Drift D-RNC and is connected to the upper S-RNC by means of an Iur interface. The UTRAN with the served UEs constitute a Radio Network Subsystem (RNS) disclosed in TS 23.110. The GSM-BSS block includes a plurality of BTSs connected to a Base Station Controller BSC by means of an Abis Interface and to the UEs through an on-air Um interface. The BSC is interfaced to the Core Network CN by means of a Gb interface (packet switched) and is further connected to a Transcoder and Rate Adaptor Unit TRAU also connected to the Core Network CN through an A interface. It is also connected to an Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC). The CN network includes the following Network Elements: Switching Centre MSC/Visitor Location Register VLRi, Gateway MSC GMSC, Interworking Function IWF/Transcoder TC, Camel Service Environment CSE, Equipment Identity Register EIR, Home Location Register HLR, Authentication Centre AuC, Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN, and Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN. The following interfaces are visible inside the CN block: A, E, Gs, F, C, D, Gf, Gr, Gc, Gn, and Gi. The IWF block translates the Iu(CS) interface into the A interface towards MSC/VLR block. The TC element performs the transcoding function for speech compression/expansion concerning UTRAN (differently from GSM where this function is performed outside the CN network) also connected to the MSC block through the A interface. The GMSC is connected to the MSC/VLR through the E interface and to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN and an Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN. Blocks CSE, EIR, HLR, AUC are connected to the MSC/VLR through, in order, the Gs, F, C, and D interfaces, and to the SGSN node through the Gf and Gr interfaces. The SGSN block is interfaced at one side to the S-RNC inside UTRAN block by means of the Iu(PS) interface, and to the BSC inside the GSM-BSS block through the Gb interface. At the other side the SGSN node is interfaced to the GGSN node through the Gn interface. The last block is connected through the Gi interface to a packet data switching network of the IP (Internet Protocol) type and/or the X.25 type. The Core Network CN of FIG. 1 consists of an enhanced GSM Phase 2+, as described in TS 23.101, with a Circuit Switched CS part and a packet Switched part (GPRS). Another important Phase 2+is the CAMEL (Customised Application for Mobile network Enhanced Logic) Application Part (CAP) used between the MSC and CSE for Intelligent Network (IN) applications. CAP is described in TS 29.078. In operation, the MSC, so as the SGSN node, keep records of the individual locations of the mobiles and performs the safety and access control functions. More BSS and RNS blocks are connected to the CN Network, which is able to perform intrasystem handovers between adjacent RNSs or between adjacent BSSs, and intersystem handovers between a RNS and an adjacent BSS. UTRAN in respect of GSM further improves data service by making possible greater throughputs and the asymmetrical traffic typical of the Internet Protocol (IP). The network of FIG. 1, which only represents a minimal part of a world-wide network, shall allow the routing of a telephone call inside an International UMTS/GSM Service Area subdivided into National Service Areas. By way of the hierarchical structure of the network, each National Service Area is subdivided into the following nested domains of decreasing area: PLMN Service Area; MSC/SGSN Service Area; Location Area LA (CS-domain) uniquely defined by its LAI (Location Area Identity) code; Routing Area RA inside the SGSN Service Area as a partition of the CS Location Area; Cell Area where the UE is actually located in the radio coverage of a target Node B or BTS. Many protocols are deputed to govern the exchange of information at the various interfaces of the multi-RAT network of FIG. 1. These protocols are largely based on the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model for CCITT (Comit&#xe9; Consultatif International T&#xe9;l&#xe9;graphique et T&#xe9;lephonique) Applications (Rec. X.200). The OSI model is partitioned into seven layers. From the point of view of a particular layer, the adjacent lower layer provides a &#x201c;transfer service&#x201d; with specific features. The way in which the lower layer is realised is immaterial to the next higher layer. Correspondingly, the lower layer is not concerned with the meaning of the information coming from the higher layer or the reason for its transfer. Historically the problem of designing a well reliable signalling system has been posed in the PSTNs domain. For this aim a CCITT Signalling System N&#xb0; 7 has been developed to provide an internationally standardised general purpose Common Channel Signalling (CCS) system. CCS is a signalling method in which a single channel conveys, by means of labelled messages, signalling information relating to, for example, a multiplicity of circuits, or other information such as that used for network management. Common Channel Signalling can be regarded as a form of data communication that is specialised for various types of signalling and information transfer between processors in telecommunications networks. The signalling system uses signalling links for transfer of signalling messages between telephone exchanges or other nodes in the telecommunication network served by the system. Relevant SS7 standards are published, and regularly updated, as ITU-T Q.7xx Recommendations. SS7 signalling as been gradually enriched with new functions suitable for the incoming digital PLMNs, the Intelligent Networks, and the Packet Switch service. To support PLMNs, a Mobile Application Part (MAP) has been developed by ETSI. MAP (TS 29.002) is the most important Level 4 Application Part, because it regulates the mobility aspects of the users. Typical MAP functions are, e.g.: store routing information in the HLR register, update and clear VLR location information, delivery &#x26; updating user profiles in the HLR and VLR, IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) check, Inter-MSC handover, etc. The general protocol architecture of the signalling used in the network includes an Access Stratum with a superimposed Non-Access Stratum (NAS). The Access Stratum includes Interface protocols and Radio protocols for exchanging User data and control information between the CN and the UE. These protocols contain mechanisms for transferring NAS messages transparently, i.e. the so-called Direct Transfer DT procedures. The NAS stratum includes higher level protocols to handle control aspects, such as: Connection Management CM, Mobility Management MM, GPRS Mobility Management GMM, Session Management SM, Short Message Service SMS, etc. Said general protocol architecture is designed in horizontal layers and vertical planes, taken as logically independent of each other. At the various RAT interfaces, two main horizontal layers are present: an upper Radio Network Layer and a lower Transport Network Layer, in the latter the Physical Layer corresponding to the Level 1 is present. Three vertical planes are generally present, respectively: a Control Plane, a User Plane and a Transport Network Control Plane. The User Plane includes the Data Stream(s) and the data Bearer(s) for the Data Stream(s). Each data stream is characterised by one or more frame protocols specified for those interfaces. The User Plane is used to transport all user data, e.g.: speech data or packet data. The Control Plane includes several Application Protocols used for all control signalling which is procedure specific. The Control Plane also includes the Signalling Bearer(s) for transporting the Application Protocol messages. The Transport Network Control Plane is used for all control signalling within the Transport Network Layer; it does not contain any Radio Network Layer information. The Transport Network Control Plane acts as plane between the Control Plane and the User Plane, it enables the Application Protocols in the Control Plane to be totally independent from the technology selected for data bearer in the User Plane. The Layer 1 functions are the ones that interface to the physical medium (e.g.: optical fibre, radio link, copper cable) to offer the clock extraction capability and transmission quality control. The physical medium shall comply with some well known standards, i.e. SDH, SONET, Ex, Tx, etc. The ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is used on Layer 2 of the UTRAN's Transport Network Layer; to say, for all 3 Planes of the Iu (TS 25.412), Iur (TS 25.422) and Iub (TS 25.432) interfaces. The ATM mode enables the transmission of Real Time (RT) data, such as speech &#x26; video, as well as Non-Real Time (NRT) data, such as packet data, computer files and graphics. FIG. 2 shows the main protocol stacks of the CS and PS Control Plane referred, without limitation, to the only UMTS network of FIG. 1. A similar figure exists even for the GSM part. At the bottom of FIG. 2 the following elements: UE, Node B, D-RNC, S-RNC, CN and the respective interfaces Uu, Iub, Iur, Iu [Iu(CS), Iu(PS)] are depicted. The bottom part of the Control Plane includes the Transport Layer upon which the Radio Protocols and the protocols of the Non Access Stratum reside. The Transport Layer includes the elements of the Transport Network Layer, to say: the L1 and L2 layers and an Access Link Control Application Part (ALCAP). The NAS protocols are also indicated in FIG. 2. With reference to FIG. 2, the Transport Plane on the Uu interface is the same as described in the User Plane, it consists of Level 1 UTRA FDD or TDD mode and Level 2 protocols MAC (Medium Access Control) and RLC (Radio Link Control). The Transport Plane on the Iub, Iur and Iu interfaces again consists of the same Level 1 as described in the User Plane. ATM and AAL1-3 are used as Layer 2 signalling protocols, in particular the ALCAP application part. The indicated Radio Protocols are the following: RRC (Radio Resource Protocol), NBAP (Node B Application Part), RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part), RANAP (Radio Access Network Application Part). In operation, RRC is used as Layer 3 protocol for controlling the information transfer between UE and UTRAN. RRC messages carry all the information required to set-up, modify, or release Radio Links (RL), which carry in their payload higher layer NAS signalling and enable UE mobility in RRC Connected mode. NBAP is used as Layer 3 protocol on the Iub interface. It carries common signalling or dedicated signalling between C-RNC and Node Bs. RNSAP is used as Layer 3 protocol on the Iur interface. It supports basic inter-RNC mobility and DCH traffic, as well as CCH traffic transmission. RANAP is used as Layer 3 protocol on the Iu interface. It is used for signalling between UTRAN and the Core network CN. RANAP is responsible on Iu for e.g.: Paging, RAB (Radio Access Bearer) management, S-RNC relocation, security and overload control, and the NAS signalling transfer. The indicated NAS Protocols are the following: MM (Mobility Management), GMM (GPRS MM), SM (Session Management), and CM (Connection Management). MM supports function such as: UE attach/detach, security functions, and location/routing area updates. SM supports Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context activation/de-activation for PS connections. CM is used for Circuit Switched Call Control, Supplementary Services, and SMS support. Besides RANAP and RRC contain Direct Transfer procedures for transparent NAS message transfer between UEs and the Core Network CN. The main purpose of the network of FIG. 1 is that to route speech signals and packet data among different points of a wide geographical network assuring in the meanwhile the possibly best Quality of Service (QoS) to the end user. QoS is an important aspect of the GSM and UMTS specification, consequently. To reach a prefixed QoS a lot of parameters are continuously measured and the measures reported to the various entities involved in this task, both for uplink and downlink. In the following some examples of QoS concepts are given for GPRS and UMTS. GPRS QoS is specified in TS 22.060 (former GSM 02.60) and TS 23.060 (former GSM 03.60). An individual QoS profile is associated with each PDP (Packet Data Protocol) context. The QoS profile is considered to be a single parameter with multiple data transfer attributes. It defines the quality of service expected in terms of the following attributes: precedence class, delay class, reliability class, peak throughput class, and mean throughput class. There are many possible QoS profiles defined by the combinations of the attributes. A PLMN may support only a limited subset of the possible QoS profiles. During the QoS profile negotiation defined in subclause &#x201c;Activation Procedures&#x201d;, it shall be possible for the MS (Mobile Station, presently considered as the UE) to request a value for each of the QoS attributes, including the HLR-stored subscribed default values. The network shall negotiate each attribute to a level that is in accordance with the available GPRS resources. The network shall always attempt to provide adequate resources to support the negotiated QoS profiles. The service precedence class indicates the relative importance of maintaining the service commitments under abnormal conditions, for example which packets are discarded in the event of problems such as limited resources or network congestion. The precedence classes are defined in High, Medium, and Low priority. The delay class defines the maximum values for the mean delay and 95-percentile delay to be incurred by the transfer of data through the GPRS network(s). The delay parameter defines the end-to-end transfer delay incurred in the transmission of SDUs (Service Data Unit) through the GPRS network(s). This includes the radio channel access delay (on uplink) or radio channel scheduling delay (on downlink), the radio channel transit delay (uplink and/or downlink paths) and the GPRS-network transit delay (multiple hops). It does not include transfer delays in external networks. Four delay classes exist. As a minimum the PLMN shall support the best effort delay class 4. The reliability class defines the probability of loss of, duplication of, mis-sequencing of, or corruption of SDUs. The peak throughput is measured in units of octets per second. It specifies the maximum rate at which data is expected to be transferred across the network for an individual PDP context. There is no guarantee that this peak rate can be achieved or sustained for any time period, this depends upon the MS capability and available radio resources. The network may limit the subscriber to the negotiated peak data rate, even if additional transmission capacity is available. The peak throughput is independent of the delay class, that determines the per-packet GPRS network transit delay. The mean throughput is measured in units of octets per hour. It specifies the average rate at which data is expected to be transferred across the GPRS network during the remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context. The network may limit the subscriber to the negotiated mean data rate (e.g., for flat-rate charging), even if additional transmission capacity is available. A &#x201c;best effort&#x201d; mean throughput class may be negotiated, and means that throughput shall be made available to the MS on a per need and availability basis. UMTS QoS is specified in TS 23.107. There are four different QoS classes: conversational class; streaming class; interactive class; and background class. The main distinguishing factor between these QoS classes is how delay sensitive the traffic is: Conversational class is meant for traffic which is very delay sensitive while Background class is the most delay insensitive traffic class. Conversational class mainly regards telephony speech (e.g. GSM). But with Internet and multimedia a number of new applications will require this scheme, for example voice over IP and video conferencing tools. The maximum transfer delay is given by the human perception of video and audio conversation. Therefore the limit for acceptable transfer delay is very strict, as failure to provide low enough transfer delay will result in unacceptable lack of quality. The transfer delay requirement is therefore both significantly lower and more stringent than the round trip delay of the interactive traffic case. Streaming class is characterised by that the time relations (variation) between information entities (i.e. samples, packets) within a flow shall be preserved, although it does not have any requirements on low transfer delay. As the stream normally is time aligned at the receiving end (in the user equipment), the highest acceptable delay variation over the transmission media is given by the capability of the time alignment function of the application. Acceptable delay variation is thus much greater than the delay variation given by the limits of human perception. Interactive class is applied when the end-user, that is either a machine or a human, is on line requesting data from remote equipment (e.g. a server). Examples of human interaction with the remote equipment are: web browsing, data base retrieval, server access. Examples of machines interaction with remote equipment are: polling for measurement records and automatic data base enquiries (tele-machines). Interactive traffic is the other classical data communication scheme that on an overall level is characterised by the request response pattern of the end-user. At the message destination there is an entity expecting the message (response) within a certain time. Round trip delay time is therefore one of the key attributes. Another characteristic is that the content of the packets shall be transparently transferred (with low bit error rate). Background class is applied when the end-user, that typically is a computer, sends and receives data-files during background processing. Examples are background delivery of E-mails, SMS, download of databases and reception of measurement records. Background traffic is one of the classical data communication schemes that on an overall level is characterised by that the destination is not expecting the data within a certain time. The scheme is thus more or less delivery time insensitive. Another characteristic is that the content of the packets shall be transparently transferred (with low bit error rate). These classes can be grouped as groups of RT (real time) and NRT (non-real time) services, for example: RT traffic corresponds to the Conversational and Streaming traffic classes, while NRT traffic corresponds to the Interactive and Background traffic classes. Separated uplink and downlink values are considered for the services. Uplink is intended for transmissions from the UE to the Node B, or from the MS to the BTS. Downlink is intended the contrary direction of transmission. In the scope of a Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM), current GSM and UMTS systems are allowed to exchange cell capacity and load information among RNCs/BSCs. In the currently standardised Rel5 solution in RNSAP (TS 25.423 v5.6.0) and RANAP (TS 25.413 v5.4.0), the following Information Elements (IEs) concerning GSM and UMTS cells are specified and transferred among RNC/BSCs. We refer here for example to the definitions contained in RNSAP, that are nevertheless reflected in RANAP: Cell Capacity Class Value: in order to compare the capacity available for user traffic within a cell among different operators' cells. Divided in two values (one for uplink, one for downlink): range: [1 . . 100]. Load Value: in order to indicate the total load in the cell, as a percentage of the capacity indicated by the Cell Capacity Class Value. Divided in two values (one for uplink, one for downlink): range: [0.100]. RT Load Value: in order to indicate the load percentage due to RT services relative to the Load Value. Divided in two values (one for uplink, one for downlink): range: [0 . . 100]. The NRT Load Value is not explicitly defined in the specification because directly obtainable by 100 minus RT Load. NRT Load Information [0.3]. The abovementioned NRT Load Value [0.100] was not felt as sufficient, because of the characteristics of NRT traffic, that can tolerate delays and non continuous transmissions. It was therefore decided to also define an Uplink/Downlink NRT Load Information, where the different values have the following meaning: 0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High: the probability to admit a new user is low, 3: Overloaded: the probability to admit a new user is low, packets are discarded and the source is recommended to reduce the data flow. The goal of the Cell Capacity Class Value would be to allow e.g. the RNC that receives this indication to figure out (by combining this information with the load values) whether there is still free capacity in the cell or not, in order to decide whether the cell can be considered as a potential target cell for handover or not. Coming to the description of the procedures that are used by the current Rel5 solution for the transfer of said IEs, a few different means are foreseen: between RNCs on the Iur interfaces by usage of the &#x201c;Common measurement&#x201d; procedure (for Load Value, RT Load Value and NRT Load Information IEs) and the &#x201c;Information Exchange&#x201d; procedure (for the Cell Capacity Class IE), on the Iur-g interface between an RNC and a BSC, and between BSCs by using the same Iur procedures. between GERAN and UTRAN, and in particular between an RNC and an A/Gb-mode-only BSC, by attaching the load information onto existing inter-RNC/BSC handover/relocation messages, between A/Gb mode BSCs by attaching the load information onto existing inter-RNC/BSC handover/relocation messages. A Work Item on improvements of CRRM methods is the subject of the following 3GPP TR 25.891, titled: &#x201c;Improvement of RRM across RNS and RNS/BSS (Release 6)&#x201d;. In this document a functional model is proposed in which the whole set of radio resources for an operator is considered to be partitioned into &#x201c;radio resource pools&#x201d;. Making reference to FIG. 3, these radio resource pools are controlled by two different types of functional entities: RRM entity: functional entity responsible for Radio Resource Management of one radio resource pool, i.e. this characterises the radio resource pool; CRRM entity: functional entity responsible for a Common Radio Resource Management, i.e. coordination of overlapping/neighbour radio resource pools controlled by different RRM entities. This new CRRM entity is introduced to allow some kind of coordination among different radio resource pools whose radio resources are linked to the same geographic area in the network. Interfaces and functions are foreseen between a CRRM entity and one or more RRM entities and between two CRRM entities, but not between two RRM entities directly. Information on other systems (e.g. inter system measurements GSM/UTRAN) can be retrieved through either the Core Network interfaces or the Iur-g interface between RNC and BSC. The functional relationships between the entities of the functional model are based on two types of functions: Reporting Information and RRM Decision Support. Interactions of CRRM and RRM with O&#x26;M (Operation and Maintenance) for the exchange of configuration information are possible. With reference to the FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 the following CRRM topologies are provided: 1. CRRM integrated into every RNC/BSC (FIG. 4); 2. CRRM integrated only in some RNC/BSCs (FIG. 5); 3. CRRM as a stand-alone server (FIG. 6). The approach illustrated in FIG. 4 is characterised by the co-location of RRM and responsible CRRM entities. The functional interface between RRM and CRRM is not realised as an open interface in this solution. Only &#x201c;Reporting Information&#x201d; is exchanged over open interfaces. The depicted solution is the base of the current Re15 solution, allowing to transfer cell capacity and load information among RNCs and BSCs using the information exchange/common measurement procedures via the Iur and Iur-g interfaces, or handover/relocation procedures via A/Iu interfaces. Only &#x201c;Reporting Information&#x201d; function on the interface between different CRRM entities is standardised (mainly as a cell load exchange). The &#x201c;Reporting Information&#x201d; function between CRRM and RRM entities and the &#x201c;RRM Decision Support&#x201d; is vendor specific since the CRRM entity must be integrated in every RNC/BSC which has to support CRRM. The approach illustrated in FIG. 5 is characterised by the co-location of CRRM with RRM for only one RNC/BSC. This integrated solution is allowing for open interfaces between RRM and CRRM (for the cases where RRM is not co-located with CRRM). The approach illustrated in FIG. 6 implements RRM and CRRM entities into separate nodes. All of the interfaces among RRMs and CRRMs are open. Thanks to the different topologies of the FIG. 3-6 an effective CRRM policy based approach is possible for load management. The introduction of an open interface between CRRM and both RNS and BSS allows the collection of traffic load information from several RNCs/BSCs for the aim of taking optimal decisions concerning Handovers and, in an equivalent way for data, Cell Reselections. CRRM entity is not supposed to be consulted for channel switching or for soft handover, since the RRM in RNC/BSC shall handle these kind of cases. The considered handovers are of the following type: between two RNCs; between two BSCs; between an RNC and a BSC, and vice versa. The basic idea behind the &#x201c;Policy-based CRRM approach&#x201d; is the standardisation of parameters and information exchange over an open interface between RRM and CRRM entities. This would enable the CRRM entity to provide CRRM policies to the RRM entities, thus allowing the traffic situation in the network to be dynamically adjusted on the basis of a common strategy. In this proposal the CRRM entity only acts as an advisor, so that the RRM entities still take the final decisions (RRM is the master), but based on parameters adjusted by a centralised CRRM. According to this policy, while the RRM entities take the fast decisions required for each Access Request or Handover Request, the CRRM entity works at a slower time scale and provides policies to the RRM entities whenever an update is necessary. In this sense the frequency for a policy update depends on the traffic variations within the involved cells. The updating frequency can also be subject to configuration. The CRRM entity would be able to work on a faster time scale than O&#x26;M, in order to dynamically react to traffic load variations in overlapping radio resource pools. The &#x201c;CRRM policy based approach&#x201d; describes the functional relationship between CRRM and RRM by three functions: 1. CRRM triggers RRM to report measurement/load information or RRM reports initiated by the RRM entity itself. 2. CRRM can inform RRM about CRRM related information (e.g.: cell capacity and load situation of neighbour cells which are not under control of this RRM function. 3. CRRM sets load targets for the RRM functions for which the CRRM entity is responsible. This can be obtained by the following four procedures: Measurement Initiating Procedure (CRRM initiated): CRRM triggers RRM to report a load measurement for a cell which is controlled by this RRM function. The report characteristics may be e.g. periodic, on demand, or event driven (e.g. by a load level). The possibility to report load measurements for more than 1 cell at one time should be allowed. Measurement Reporting Procedure (RRM initiated): Here the RRM may report load measurements per measurement object to the CRRM which is responsible for this RRM. Neighbour Cell CRRM Information Procedure (CRRM initiated): Based on the measurements received from different RRMs the CRRM derives the &#x201c;Neighbour Cell CRRM Information&#x201d; (distinguished per cell and per service) and sends it to all possibly affected RRM instances (neighbour cells in this sense are only those neighbour cells controlled by neighbour RRMs, since for cells of its own RRM no support is needed). This information is then used by the RRM in case of a handover (if cells of neighbour RRMs are involved) to prioritise the target cell. Load Target Setting Procedure (CRRM initiated): When a load target&#x2014;which can dynamically be set by CRRM per cell&#x2014;is exceeded, the serving RRM of the according cell takes autonomous RRM decisions based on the provided policy (Neighbour Cell CRRM Information, e.g. ranking of target cells). This concerns the following RRM decisions: Handover due to load reasons. Redirect due to load reasons. The procedure advises RRM to aim at a certain load level within a cell, however the resulting actions must not increase blocking and dropping rates for calls in the corresponding cell. Cell capacity and load situation parameters managed by said procedures constitute as many Information Elements (IE) included in respective fields of relevant messages foreseen in the specifications. APPROACH TO THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM The standardised Cell Capacity and cell load Information Elements listed above, that are exchanged between radio network controllers even of different RATs, are largely insufficient to make a CRRM plenty effective. Relevant causes of said insufficiency so as partial remedies to the consequent drawbacks have been disclosed in two patent applications of the same Applicant (SIEMENS) designing the same inventor, namely: 1. EP 02425674.5, filed on 6-11-2002, titled: &#x201c;TRAFFIC LOAD MANAGEMENT METHOD BASED ON THE EXCHANGE OF SERVICE SPECIFIC FREE CAPACITY INFORMATION ELEMENTS AMONG RADIO ACCESS NETWORK CONTROLLERS&#x201d;. 2. EP 02425675.2, filed on 6-11-2002, titled: &#x201c;QoS BASED TRAFFIC LOAD MANAGEMENT METHOD IN A MULTI-RAT NETWORK&#x201c;. The invention disclosed in the first patent application (EP 02425674.5) concerns the opportunity to consider, in addition to the aforementioned standardised Information Elements for Cell Capacity/Load RT/NRT, new service specific Free Capacity Information Elements. These IEs are defined to indicate the available free capacity for a given service by taking into account the capacity that is configured for that service and the actual occupation of this capacity. Service specific Free Capacity IEs take into account free capacity on both dedicated and shared resources, they are exchanged among different radio network controllers to allow the issue of optimal decisions concerning intra-RAT or inter-RAT handovers, or cell reselections for packet data. Always in the first patent application a centralised dynamical resource reservation method is further disclosed. According to the method, new service specific capacity settings parameters are set by a centralised CRRM entity for every RRM entity. The purpose of these settings is to ask the RRM to reserve a certain amount of resources for certain services. Moreover, the new service specific capacity settings parameters allow for a dynamical resource reservation to specific services with clear benefits on central traffic steering capabilities in a multi-RAT network accessed by a varying population of multi-mode terminals. The invention disclosed in the second patent application (EP 02425675.2) concerns the impact of traffic load on the QoS. Traffic load in the cells may seriously affect QoS either directly or indirectly. A traffic congestion situation directly affect the overall QoS if the incoming calls are to be refused, so as handovers towards the congested cell. The congestion indirectly affect the experienced QoS when the network is forced to downgrade the actual quality in order to add up new traffic. For example, in the old GSM a cell load dependent activation of Half Rate (HR) channels TCH/H instead of Full Rate TCH/F can be implemented within a cell where dual rate channels are configured. In a more sophisticated way an Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) code is provided both for GSM and UMTS. According to the method of the secondly cited patent application (EP 02425675.2), in addition to the standardised Information Elements exchanged for the aim of cell load traffic management among RRM entities (via one or more CRRM entities), new Information Elements corresponding to service specific cell QoS Indicators are added up. That enables to distinguish the general service specific QoS situation in the cell, in order to take reliable decisions concerning handovers or cell reselections among different radio access network controllers. The optimal decision is a consequence of an improved strategy for balancing between RT and NRT traffic inside singular cells of a same RAT. OUTLINED TECHNICAL PROBLEM As previously said, by exchanging cell information, one RNC can for example know about the service specific free/reserved capacity and/or the QoS situation of a neighbouring GSM cell, or vice versa. However, even if the above proposals try to save as much as possible of the 3GPP UMTS/GSM Release 5 (Rel5) solution by enhancing it in two of the most critical issues, a number of problems remains: In relation to the &#x201c;Cell Capacity Class IE&#x201d; one of the above proposals was solving the issue of &#x201c;reserved capacities&#x201d; for specific services. However, another problem is that &#x201c;Cell Capacity Class IE&#x201d; is meant to indicate a &#x201c;static capacity&#x201d;, but capacity is nowadays a &#x201c;soft capacity&#x201d;, i.e. a dynamic capacity, therefore it is difficult to give reasonable meaning to such an IE and it is difficult if not impossible to define it for a cell in a way that can be useful for CRRM purposes. Factors that play a major role in determining the &#x201c;soft capacity effect are: user mobility, cell breathing, QoS, signalling traffic, higher modulations and specific technologies like HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), EGPRS (Enhanced GPRS), ECSD (Enhanced Circuit Switched Data), E-DCH (Enhanced Dedicated Channel), MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output). All of these factors lead to the impossibility to determine a static capacity in terms of e.g. kbit/s with a sufficient precision: the same cell might support in some cases a maximum of 1220 kbit/s, while in other cases it could support a maximum of 4880 kbit/s, while in other cases where e.g. HSDPA is used this capacity might go up to around 10000 kbit/s. In the end, even assuming that we would fix an average value for the IE for a given cell, the indeterminacy that it would carry would be so high that its applicability would be extremely limited, and it would be impossible to derive from that value any information of user-available capacity in kbit/s for a specific service without considering other cell specific important information that are not part of the Rel5 solution. In relation to the Load Values, one of the above proposals was solving the issue of &#x201c;provided vs. guaranteed bitrate&#x201d;. However, more issues are identified in the following. The idea of comparing Load Values is the common basis of CRRM solutions since GSM early phases where the coordination of different BSCs was tackled in standardisation: a &#x201c;Load Indication Procedure&#x201d; was defined for this purpose in GSM 8.08 (now renamed as TS 48.008). We are however not aware of any implementation of such ideas in GSM systems. Load values are known to be a basic input to cell specific CAC (Call Admission Control) algorithms that vary among systems and consider cell/system specific thresholds and settings. Therefore it is practically impossible to directly compare load values from different systems without using their specific CAC algorithms. On the other hand, it would be absurd to implement in every RNC/BSC CAC algorithms for every possible technology and every posible cell configuration. Moreover, Rel5 Load Value and RT Load Value are defined as percentages and refer to percentages of the Cell Capacity Class. This gives an indication of a possibility to &#x201c;calculate&#x201d; load in terms of occupied capacity, and the possibility to &#x201c;calculate&#x201d; a free capacity by substraction from a total capacity that would be indicated by Cell Capacity Class, but this is not possible due to the big indetermination that the Rel5 solution carries. Summarising, it is conceptually impossible to directly compare load values from different systems, and referencing the load values to an ambiguous indication of static capacity would make it worse. The Rel5&#x201c;NRT Load Information&#x201d; gives again a very undefined and ambiguous information. In general, it does not help to know if the cell can accept a certain NRT service characterised by a Maximum Bitrate, a specific technology, a certain priority or a certain need for the cell change to be made. All the Rel5 solutions do not say anything about extremely important technologies like HSDPA, EGPRS, HSCSD or ECSD. The Rel5 solution cannot therefore consider at all these kind of resources during inter-RNC/BSC cell changes. It is therefore evident how the current Rel5 approach to the problem brings to a number of issues that compromise the whole solution. The current Rel5 approach is vague, lacks important information, and the generality of the definition of its IEs make it possible for different kinds of interpretations that all contribute to enlarge the indeterminacy on each IE. Even if it would be easily possible to set some values to those IEs, the indeterminacy that they would suffer would make it impossible to use them consistently in the receiving node, therefore making the whole solution useless. It is highly expected that the current Rel5 solution as it was standardised will never be implemented due to deficiency of achievable gains. Summarising, the major problem of the prior art, in particular the current Rel5 solution, is identified in the following: it tries to provide a limited and insufficient number of parameters, that are specific to a certain system, to a different system that is in fact not capable to interpret the received information. I.e.: cell capacities and loads are somehow CAC parameters that are system specific, and so are the CAC algorithms in every RNC/BSC with their different thresholds, settings and system specific strategies: the current Rel5 solution is based on the wong approach where CAC parameters specific to e.g. UMTS are provided to CAC algorithms specific to e.g. GSM, therefore creating a fundamental incompatibility or indeterminacy. In the UMTS SRNC case the situation is even worse: GSM specific CAC parameters are provided to the SRNC that does not normally implement any CAC algorithm. Summarising, the Rel5 solution is based on a totally wrong approach as it brings information to a place that lacks the capability to interpret this information. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The main object of the present invention is that to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art (disclosed both in the current standardisation and the two cited patent applications) concerning Information Elements to be exchanged among various entities deputed to CRRM/RRM upon a geographical area where cells of several Radio Access Technologies overlap and to indicate a Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) method in a multi-RAT cellular telephone network. SUMMARY AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION To achieve said objects the subject of the present invention is a common radio resource management method, as disclosed in the claims. Having above identified the major problem of current Rel5 solution, the disclosed method depicts a completely new approach to the problem that eludes all the presented Rel5 drawbacks by eliminating the major problem at the basis. The disclosed method foresees that the source system directly provides the target system with a description of the available bearer services in the concerned cells of the source system. This description is obtained in the source system as an output of system specific CAC-like algorithms that make use of system specific parameters like cell capacity, loads and others. CAC-like algorithms are tasked to make CAC-estimations, i.e. predictions on the bearer service availabilities of a particular cell. This information should be considered in the receiving node prior to a cell change towards that particular cell. The description of the Cell Availabilities includes description of the Bearer Service Availability for a number of fundamental types of bearer services. Bearer services are distinguished by traffic class: Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background. This distinction is due to the different QoS characteristics of these bearer services in terms of Eb/No, error rates, priorities, delay and others, for which these classes have different typical requirements, leading to a significant difference among these bearer service types. Bearer services can also be distinguished by specific radio access technology, i.e. HSCSD, ECSD, EGPRS, HSDPA, E-DCH, MIMO, leading to the description of e.g. the Interactive HSDPA Bearer Service Availability. The Bearer Service Availability for a specific bearer type can be described separately for uplink and downlink, or for both uplink and downlink in one instance. The Bearer Service Availability for a specific bearer type can be described in terms of: availability of the bearer service for any cell change or just for the strictly necessary ones. The latter option would exclude availability for cell changes due to load reason or traffic reason, or directed retry. maximum user bitrate in kbit/s that can currently be provided to the single user for the specified type of cell change, or indication that the bearer service is currently unavailable. This would refer to the Guaranteed bitrate for Conversational and Streaming bearer services, or to the Maximum bitrate for Interactive and Background bearer services. indication of whether the specified bearer service can be provided to a high number of users, or only to a limited number of users. In order to allow this functionality to be totally exploited, the network can make use of knowledge on: UE/MS capabilities to support specific technologies: HSCSD, ECSD, GPRS, EGPRS, FDD, TDDhcr, TDDlcr, HSDPA, E-DCH, MIMO. Cell capabilities to support specific technologies: HSCSD, ECSD, GPRS, EGPRS, FDD, TDDhcr, TDDlcr, HSDPA, E-DCH, MIMO. Advantages of the Invention are Listed: l. The RNC does not need to know about GSM peculiarities in order to evaluate a load value, but can just check the availability of a specific service considering also the UE capabilities. The same applies for all the combinations of source and target RAT and specific cell configurations. 2. Evaluation of load values and available capacities are done in the correct node: the Controlling node where CAC is placed. The Rel5 solution instead places the evaluation of load values in the Serving node where the appropriate CAC evaluation algorithm is often missing. 3. The proposed solution considers the most important technologies (HSDPA, EGPRS, . . . ) for each system (GSM, UMTS, . . . ). 4. The proposed solution is feasible and it avoids the complexity of calculation and settings of the Rel5 IEs, and it avoids the resulting interoperability problems among different systems and vendors. 5. Unambiguity of the IEs at the receiving node: the receiving node can immediately evaluate whether a service can be placed into that cell or not, and it can also make a comparisons among different cells. 6. The solution considers all the open issues indicated for the Rel5 solution (e.g. reserved capacities, provided vs. guaranteed bitrate, priorities, signaling load, . . . ) as they are implicitly considered in the determination of &#x201c;Cell Availabilities IE&#x201d; in the right place, i.e. in the Controlling node, that, being responsible of controlling the concerned cells, is the most suitable place for this estimation.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a driving device for a stepping motor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a driving device for a stepping motor, which is used for a meter mounted on a vehicle, the initialization processing of which is improved. Recently, stepping motors have been frequently used for speedometers to display a vehicle speed or for tachometers to display a rotating speed of an engine for the reasons of improving the indicating accuracy and reducing the manufacturing cost. However, in a vehicle on which a meter having the above stepping motor is mounted, by an erroneous signal generated by vibration or noise of the vehicle, an actual moving distance of an indicating needle of the meter, which is linked with the rotation of the stepping motor, becomes different from an original moving distance of the indicating needle of the meter. Therefore, in the case of the meter mounted on a vehicle in which this stepping motor is used, the following initialization processing is conducted. For example, at the time when the ignition switch has been turned on, the stepping motor is reversed in the direction of the stopper, and the indicating needle is returned to the zero position determined by the stopper. In this initialization processing, in order to detect whether or not the indicating needle, the position of which is controlled by the stepping motor, comes into contact with the stopper by which the zero position of the indicating needle is determined, an induced voltage generated by the rotation of the rotor of the stepper motor is detected, and when the thus detected induced voltage becomes not more than a predetermined threshold value, the zero position detecting processing is conducted in which the indicating needle has collided with the stopper, which is set at the zero position, and stopped. Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, this zero position detecting processing is explained below. FIG. 14 is a diagram showing a relation among each excitation step in the zero position detecting processing, the zero position detecting excitation pattern, the detection timing and the induced voltage. FIG. 15 is a view showing a relation between each excitation step in FIG. 14 and the rotating pattern of the rotor. Numerals in the parentheses represent the rotary angles of the rotor. Numerals in the rectangles represent the step numbers. In this connection, in these views, it is estimated that the rotor of the stepping motor is rotated in the direction indicated by an arrow at the time of zero position detection processing. This rotor has three N-poles and S-poles which are alternately arranged and uniformly magnetized. An exciting signal for rotating the rotor is composed of exciting pulses P1, P2, P3 and P4 in which H (high level) and L (low level) are combined. For example, H is 5 volt and L is 0 volt. Exciting pulses P1 and P2 are supplied to both end portions &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; of one exciting coil 1a1. Exciting pulses P3 and P4 are supplied to both end portions &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the other exciting coil 1a2. In order to reverse the rotor so that the indicating needle, which is connected to the rotor via a gear, can be moved to the zero position determined by the stopper, one cycle of the zero position detection exciting pattern is composed of eight exciting steps 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4 to which the same period of time is allotted, and the stepping motor is driven by the half step drive system. The exciting signals (P1, P2, P3 and P4) in the exciting step 1 are synchronized with the corresponding rotary patterns of the rotor. When the exciting step shifts in the order of 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4, the rotor is rotated by 15&#xb0; at a time as shown in FIG. 15. For example, when the step changes from the exciting step 3 to the exciting step 2, the angle of the rotor is changed from the rotary angle 0&#xb0; to 15&#xb0; by the exciting signal (P1, P2, P3 and P4). The rotary angle is changed between the exciting steps by 15&#xb0; at a time in the same manner. In this connection, when the step shifts from the exciting step 4 to the exciting step 3 in the next cycle, the rotary angle is changed by 15&#xb0;. The cycle composed of the above eight exciting steps is repeated until the indicating needle comes into contact with the stopper, that is, until the rotor can not rotate and the induced voltage detected by the exciting coil becomes lower than the threshold value. The detection timing signal for detecting the zero position is set so that it can become H at the timing when the exciting coil 1a1 is not excited, that is, at the exciting steps 1 and 5 in which the exciting pulses P1 and P2 supplied to both end portions &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the exciting coil 1a1 become L (zero volt) and at the exciting steps 3 and 7 in which the exciting pulses P3 and P4 supplied to both end portions &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the exciting coil C2 become L (zero volt). In response to this detection timing signal, the induced voltage, which is detected by the exciting coils 1a1, 1a2, one end of which is connected to the ground and the other end of which is open, is compared with the threshold value (reference voltage V). When the rotor is rotated so that the indicating needle can be moved to the zero position determined by the stopper, the indicating needle comes into contact with the stopper. Then, the induced voltage theoretically becomes zero. Therefore, the induced voltage becomes lower than the threshold value, that is, the zero position detection is conducted at this point of time. In the above zero position detection processing, the following problems may be encountered. In the zero position detection processing, the detection cycle for detecting the induced voltage is used for the half step drive system. Therefore, as shown in the vector diagram of FIG. 16, an intensity of drive torque is greatly changed between one phase exciting step and two phase exciting step in the coil A-phase (the exciting coil 1a1) and the coil B-phase (the exciting coil 1a2). Therefore, the drive torque is not constant. Further, since the rotating speed of the rotor is changed, the rotor can not be rotated smoothly. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 17, the detected induced voltage-considerably changes. Accordingly, there is a possibility of the occurrence of erroneous detection of the zero point. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a driving device of a stepping motor in which the occurrence of erroneous detection of the zero point can be prevented. In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a driving device, comprising: a stepping motor, having an exciting coil and a rotor which rotates according to a state of excitation of the exciting coil; a driven member, being driven in accordance with a rotation of the rotor; a stopper, mechanically stopping the driven member at a zero position; a controller, controlling the state of excitation of the exciting coil; an induced voltage detector, detecting an induced voltage generated by a change of magnetic flux according to the rotation of the rotor; and a zero position detector, detecting whether or not the driven member is stopped at the zero position based on the induced voltage which is detected by the induced voltage detector, wherein the controller supplies an exciting pattern, in which an electric one cycle of the exciting pattern is composed of a plurality of exciting steps for reversing the rotor by a micro-step drive system, to the exciting coil at the time of processing of zero position detection to return the driven member to the zero position; wherein the exciting pattern includes a first exciting step for detecting the induced voltage and a second exciting step for rotation; and wherein total periods of the first exciting step is greater than that of the second exciting step during an electrical angle 90&#xb0; in the one cycle. Preferably, the first exciting step has a first predetermined period of time. The second exiting step has a second predetermined period of time smaller than the first predetermined time. In the above configurations, it is possible to obtain a stable induced voltage at the time of rotation in the processing of zero position detection. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of erroneous detection of the zero position. Preferably, the micro-step drive system uses a micro-step of 1/n (n&#x2267;3). In the above configuration, the drive torque becomes substantially constant, and further the rotary angle for each exciting step is so small that no vibration is generated. The rotor rotates smoothly, and it becomes possible to obtain a stable induced voltage at the time of rotation. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of erroneous detection of the zero position. Preferably, the controller defers to detect the induced voltage for a predetermined period of time from the start at the time of processing of zero position detection. In the above configuration, it is possible to stably obtain an induced voltage at the time of rotation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"detail\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the head supporting device according to the present invention, the signal wiring is arranged so that from the head, the signal wiring runs through the supporting arm and the holding member in this order and then is connected to the electric circuit. This allows the holding member to inhibit a phenomenon in which a moment around the second swing axis is exerted on the supporting arm due to a reaction force generated in the signal wiring as a result of a bending movement of the signal wiring that is caused by a swinging motion of the supporting arm around the first swing axis. Thus, the balance of the supporting arm around the second swing axis is not affected adversely. In the head supporting device, preferably, a portion of the signal wiring that extends between the supporting arm and the holding member is formed in a sheet-like shape. Preferably, a surface of the signal wiring at the portion that is formed in the sheet-like shape is parallel to the second swing axis. Preferably, the signal wiring is bent at a portion that runs over the holding member so that a surface of the signal wiring at the portion is perpendicular to the second swing axis. Preferably, the holding member has bent parts that are formed by bending so as to sandwich the signal wiring. Preferably, the signal wiring is arranged so as to bridge between the supporting arm and the holding member in the vicinity of the second swing axis. Preferably, the head supporting device further includes a driving unit that is provided on a side of the other end of the supporting arm so as to allow the supporting arm to swing around the first swing axis. Preferably, the head supporting device further includes feeding wiring that is provided so as to supply the driving unit with a driving current for allowing the arm to swing. Preferably, the feeding wiring is arranged so that from the driving unit, the feeding wiring runs through the supporting arm and the holding member in this order and then is connected to the electric circuit. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of an embodiment with reference to the appended drawings. FIG. 1 is a plan view showing the configuration of a disk apparatus 200 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The disk apparatus 200 carries a substantially disk-shaped recording medium 13 that is provided rotatably in a chassis 18. Ahead supporting device 100 is provided in the chassis 18 of the disk apparatus 200. The head supporting device 100 supports a head 10 for performing signal recording or reproduction with respect to the recording medium 13. FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view showing the configuration of the head supporting device 100. FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing the configuration of signal wiring 1, a supporting arm 5, and a holding member 3 that are provided in the head supporting device 100. FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing the configuration of the signal wiring 1 and the supporting arm 5 that are provided in the head supporting device 100. FIG. 5 is a perspective development for explaining the configuration of the signal wiring 1 provided in the head supporting device 100. The head supporting device 100 includes the supporting arm 5. The supporting arm 5 is swingable in a plane parallel to a recording surface of the recording medium 13 around a first swing axis 31 that is perpendicular to the recording surface of the recording medium 13. The first swing axis 31 passes through the center of a bearing part 6 that is substantially in the shape of a hollow cylinder. Further, the supporting arm 5 is swingable in a plane perpendicular to the recording surface of the recording medium 13 around a second swing axis 32 that is parallel to the recording surface of the recording medium 13. The second swing axis 32 passes through vertex parts 8a and 8b (see FIG. 6 that will be described later) of a pair of protrusions 8 that are provided on a pivot bearing 7. The pivot bearing 7 is substantially in the shape of a hollow disk. The pair of protrusions 8 defining the second swing axis 32 may be of a hemispherical shape or a conical shape. Alternatively, the pair of protrusions 8 may be in the form of ridges that are arranged so that the longitudinal direction thereof is parallel to the second swing axis 32 and include the vertex parts 8a and 8b that have a cross section of a wedge shape or a circular arc shape. The head 10 is held by a slider 9, which is provided at one end of the supporting arm 5, so as to be opposed to the recording medium 13. When the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing in the plane parallel to the recording surface of the recording medium 13 around the first swing axis 31, the head 10 is allowed to move substantially along one radial direction of the recording medium 13. A member 20 that is substantially in the shape of a hollow cylinder is provided so as to be opposed to the pivot bearing 7 through the supporting arm 5. Further, the holding member 3 that is substantially in the shape of a hollow disk is provided so as to be opposed to the pivot bearing 7 through the member 20 and the supporting arm 5. Furthermore, a nut 19 is provided so as to be opposed to the bearing part 6 through the pivot bearing 7, the supporting arm 5, the member 20, and the holding member 3. A male thread is formed in the bearing part 6, and a female thread is formed in the nut 19. The male thread formed in the bearing part 6 is screwed into the female thread formed in the nut 19, and thus the bearing part 6, the pivot bearing 7, the supporting arm 5, the member 20, the holding member 3, and the nut 19 are assembled into one unit. This allows the holding member 3 to swing in the plane parallel to the recording surface of the recording medium 13 around the first swing axis 31 in conjunction with a swinging motion of the supporting arm 5 around the first swing axis 31. The head supporting device 100 is provided with the signal wiring 1. The signal wiring 1 transmits a signal to be recorded on the recording medium 13 or a signal reproduced from the recording medium 13 across a path between the head 10 and an electric circuit 12. The electric circuit 12 is provided in a fixed part 17 that is provided in the chassis 18. The signal wiring 1 is arranged so that from the head 10, the signal wiring 1 runs through the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in this order and then is connected to the electric circuit 12. In order to enable easy deformation by bending, a portion Q of the signal wiring 1 that extends between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 as shown in FIG. 4 is formed in a sheet-like shape. The surface of the signal wiring 1 at the portion Q that is formed in the sheet-like shape is virtually parallel to the surface of the supporting arm 5, i.e. parallel to the second swing axis 32. The signal wiring 1 is arranged so as to bridge between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in the vicinity of the pair of protrusions 8 (namely, the second swing axis 32). This suppresses to a minimal level a phenomenon in which a reaction force attributable to the rigidity of the signal wiring 1 is exerted on the supporting arm 5 when the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing around the second swing axis 32. The signal wiring 1 led from the electric circuit 12 is held by a flexible board 14 having flexibility and connected to another signal wiring 1 led from the supporting arm 5 at a lead-out terminal part 15 provided on the flexible board 14 using a conductive adhesive by a known method. On the holding member 3, the flexible board 14 on which the signal wiring 1 is formed is bent upward on one end by an angle of about 90 degrees along line A-A shown in FIG. 5 so that its surface is virtually perpendicular to the surface of the supporting arm 5 (i.e. so that the surface of the flexible board 14 is perpendicular to the second swing axis 32). The one end of the flexible board 14 further is bent at an angle of 180 degrees along line B-B shown in FIG. 5. The other end of the flexible board 14 is fixed to a flexure portion 25 that is provided in the fixed part 17. The flexure portion 25 is bent at an angle of 90 degrees along line C-C shown in FIG. 5. As a result, the flexible board 14 has the bent shape shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4. In the above-mentioned manner, the flexible board 14 constitutes a movable arch part 16 that extends between the lead-out terminal part 15 and the fixed part 17. The movable arch part 16 can be distorted freely so as to correspond to a swinging motion of the supporting arm 5 around the first swing axis 31. The holding member 3 has bent parts 4 that are formed by bending parallel to the first swing axis so as to sandwich the flexible board 14 on which the signal wiring 1 is formed. One end of the movable arch part 16 of the flexible board 14 is sandwiched between the bent parts 4. This allows the holding member 3 to inhibit a phenomenon in which a moment around the second swing axis 32 is exerted on the supporting arm 5 due to a reaction force generated in the movable arch part 16 when the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing around the first swing axis 31. Thus, the balance (attitude) of the supporting arm 5 around the second swing axis 32 is not affected adversely. The head supporting device 100 is provided with a voice coil motor 11. In order to allow the supporting arm 5 to swing around-the first swing axis 31, the voice coil motor 11 is provided at the side of the other end of the supporting arm 5 that is opposed to the side of the head 10 with respect to the first swing axis 31. The head supporting device 100 includes feeding wiring 2 that is provided so as to supply the voice coil motor 11 with a driving current for allowing the supporting arm 5 to swing around the first swing axis 31. The feeding wiring 2 is arranged so that from the voice coil motor 11, the feeding wiring 2 runs through the supporting arm 5, the holding member 3, and the flexible board 14 in this order and then is connected to the electric circuit 12. Herein, the operating principle of the supporting arm 5 is described in detail with reference to FIGS. 2, 6 and 7. FIG. 6 is a side view schematically showing a configuration of a head supporting device for illustrating the operating principle of the head supporting device according to the present invention, and FIG. 7 is a plan view schematically showing the configuration. As shown in FIG. 2, a pair of leaf spring parts 24 as elastic units and a spring fixing member 23 that is cantilevered through the leaf spring parts 24 are formed on the supporting arm 5 in the vicinity of the first swing axis 31. The spring fixing member 23 is fixed by being sandwiched between the pivot bearing 7 and the member 20. Thus, the supporting arm 5 is held elastically through the leaf spring parts 24 with respect to the pivot bearing 7 and the member 20. At this time, the vertex parts 8a and 8b of the pair of protrusions 8 that are provided on the surface of the pivot bearing 7 on a side opposed to the supporting arm 5 come in contact with the supporting arm 5 at points Pa and Pb, respectively, which are shown in FIG. 7. By the pair of protrusions 8, the leaf spring parts 24 are deformed elastically so that the supporting arm 5 is placed in the attitude shown by the dotted line in FIG. 6. In the case where the recording medium 13 is started to rotate for recording/reproduction, the leaf spring parts 24 are deformed elastically so as to allow the slider 9 to float up. When the supporting arm 5 is in the state shown by the solid line in FIG. 6, i.e. in the state where a predetermined gap is maintained between a magnetic head provided in the slider 9 and the magnetic recording medium 13, recording or reproduction is performed. In this case, a reaction force of the leaf spring parts 24 that acts to return the supporting arm 5 to the state shown by the dotted line in FIG. 6 is used as a pressure load to be applied to the slider 9. The second swing axis 32 is a center around which the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing in directions in which the slider 9 is brought in/out of contact with the recording medium 13. The second swing axis 32 passes through points Pa and Pb on the supporting arm 5, which come into contact with the vertex parts 8a and 8b of the pair of protrusions 8 of the pivot bearing 7, respectively. Further, the first swing axis 31 is a center around which the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing in the plane parallel to the recording surface of the recording medium 13 so that a tracking operation is performed. The first swing axis 31 orthogonally intersects the second swing axis 32 at point P. A length between point P and point Pa and a length between point P and point Pb, which are both denoted L, are equal to each other. Further, the second swing axis 32 is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the supporting arm 5. With the above-mentioned configuration of the head supporting device, a portion of the supporting arm 5 other than the leaf spring parts 24 can be formed of a material having high rigidity. Particularly, an area of the supporting arm 5 that extends from points Pa and Pb to a point to which the slider 9 is attached (hereinafter, this area of the supporting arm 5 is referred to as an &#x201c;arm main part&#x201d;) can be formed entirely of a material having high rigidity. In the case where the arm main part of the supporting arm 5 is formed of a highly rigid material as describe above, the resonance frequency of the supporting arm 5 can be increased, and thus a vibration mode is not caused, thereby eliminating the need for a time required to settle vibration. Therefore, a high-speed swinging motion and positioning of the supporting arm 5 are enabled, thereby allowing a magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus to have an increased access speed. Furthermore, the leaf spring parts 24 as the elastic units are not incorporated into the arm main part but are provided independently of the arm main part. Therefore, while the rigidity of the arm main part is secured, by changing the thickness, a material or the like of the leaf spring parts 24, the strength and a spring constant of the leaf spring parts 24 can be selected. Thus, a pressure load to be applied to the slider 9 can be set optimally. Furthermore, preferably, in the state of use of the head supporting device in which the slider 9 has floated up from the recording medium 13, the center of gravity of the supporting arm 5, which is held by means of the pair of protrusions 8 and the leaf spring parts 24 and to which the voice coil 11 and a coil holder for the voice coil 11 are attached, is positioned so as to coincide with point P where the first swing axis 31 and the second swing axis 32 intersect each other. Thus, a head supporting device can be provided in which vibration due to, for example, an impact from the exterior is not likely to be caused, and a stable operation is achieved. As described above, the swinging motion of the supporting arm 5 in the directions in which the slider 9 is bought in/out of contact with the recording medium 13 is balanced with respect to the vertex parts 8a and 8b of the pair of protrusions 8 as fulcrums. This allows a head supporting device that has excellent impact resistance to be provided. The effect of obtaining the impact resistance is attained more reliably by the configuration described in this embodiment in which the holding member 3 is used to hold the signal wiring 1. That is, the signal wiring 1 is sandwiched between the bent parts 4 that are provided on the holding member 3 so as to be perpendicular to the second swing axis 32. This reliably inhibits a phenomenon in which a moment around the second swing axis 32 is exerted on the supporting arm 5 due to a reaction force resulting from distortion of the movable arch part 16 that is caused when the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing around the first swing axis 31. Thus, the balance of the supporting arm 5 around the second swing axis 32 is not affected adversely. Moreover, the effect of obtaining the impact resistance is attained more reliably by the following configurations: a portion of the signal wiring 1 that extends between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3, namely, the portion Q shown in FIG. 4, is formed in a sheet-like shape; the portion that is formed in the sheet-like shape is set so as to be virtually parallel to the surface of the supporting arm 5 (i.e. parallel to the second swing axis 32); and the signal wiring 1 is arranged so as to bridge between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in the vicinity of the pair of protrusions 8 (namely, the second swing axis 32). This is because by these configurations, a reaction force resulting from the bending of the portion Q of the signal wiring 1 shown in FIG. 4, which is caused when the supporting arm 5 is allowed to swing around the second swing axis 32, can be suppressed to a low level. That is, regardless of the position to which the supporting arm 5 has been swung around the second swing axis 32, in other words, regardless of whether or not the slider 9 is in contact with the recording medium 13, a moment around the second swing axis 32 that is imparted to the supporting arm 5 by the signal wiring 1 can be suppressed to a minimal level, and thus the balance of the supporting arm 5 around the second swing axis 32 is not affected adversely. Needless to say, a particular effect of reducing variations in pressure load (a force biasing the slider 9 toward the recording medium 13) also can be attained by: using a structure in which the signal wiring 1 is held by the holding member 3; forming a portion of the signal wiring 1 that extends between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in a sheet-like shape; setting the portion that is formed in the sheet-like shape so that the portion is virtually parallel to the surface of the supporting arm 5; and arranging the signal wiring 1 so that the signal wiring 1 bridges between the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in the vicinity of the pair of protrusions 8. Furthermore, the holding member 3 is used to hold the signal wiring 1, and thus the mass of a portion of the signal wiring 1 that is held by the holding member 3 is not applied to the supporting arm 5. This allows the mass of the supporting arm 5 to be suppressed to an extremely small value. Thus, the resonance frequency of the supporting arm 5 can be increased, thereby also attaining the effect of increasing impact resistance. As described in the foregoing discussion, according to this embodiment, the signal wiring 1 is arranged so that from the head 10, the signal wiring 1 runs through the supporting arm 5 and the holding member 3 in this order and then is connected to the electric circuit 12. Thus, a head supporting device and a disk apparatus can be provided in which the balance of the supporting arm 5 around the second swing axis 32 is not affected adversely by a reaction force resulting from a bending movement of the signal wiring 1 that is caused by a swinging motion of the supporting arm 5 around the first swing axis 31, and excellent impact resistance is achieved. The head supporting device according to the present invention is applicable to magnetic recording/reproducing apparatuses using a magnetic head and a disk recording/reproducing apparatuses of a non-contact type such as, for example, an optical disk apparatus, a magneto-optical disk apparatus and the like. The invention may be embodied in other forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The embodiments disclosed in this application are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not limiting. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein.\",\n          \"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As a result of diligent investigation, the present inventors succeeded in finding a fluorescent dye which produces different staining characteristics between immature platelets and mature platelets, and which is excitable by a laser beam emitted from a semiconductor light source. In this way, the present inventors have invented an apparatus for measuring immature platelets, which prepares an assay sample using a staining reagent containing the aforesaid fluorescent dye, irradiates the prepared assay sample with laser light using a semiconductor light source, and detects optical information emitted from the assay sample, then classifies and counts the immature platelets (this concept includes reticulated platelets). The following examples and representative procedures illustrate features in accordance with the present invention, and are provided solely by way of illustration. They are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents. The embodiments of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets of the present invention are described below. This apparatus uses whole blood as the specimen. An assay sample which has been subjected to dilution and staining processes is prepared from the specimen, and optical information of fluorescent light and forward scattered light are detected from each particle, that is the immature platelets and mature platelets, in the assay sample using a flow cytometer. Then, the immature platelets and mature platelets included in the specimen are counted by analyzing the aforesaid optical information. FIG. 1 shows an external view of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets. The front surface of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 is provided with a liquid crystal touch panel 10 for displaying assay results and used by an operator to input various types of settings, a start switch 11 for starting an assay operation, and a probe 12 for suctioning a specimen. FIG. 2 is a diagram of the functional structures of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. The apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 is provided with a sample preparation unit 2, detection unit 3, and control unit 4. The sample preparation unit 2 is provided with a dilution fluid container 21 for accommodating a dilution fluid used for diluting a specimen, staining fluid container 22 for accommodating a staining fluid used for staining a specimen, and a reaction vessel 23 for mixing the dilution fluid, staining fluid, and a specimen suctioned through the probe 12. The reaction vessel 23 has a mixing mechanism and a temperature control mechanism not shown in the drawing. In this way the fluids within the vessel are mixed for a predetermined time while maintaining a constant temperature, so as to prepare an assay sample. The probe 12, dilution fluid container 21, and staining fluid container 22 are connected with the reaction vessel 23 through tubes. Furthermore, the reaction vessel 23 is connected to a flow cell of the detection unit 3, which is described later, through a tube. A pump and valve not shown in the drawing are provided for each tube. The specimen, dilution fluid, and staining fluid are respectively supplied to the reaction vessel 23, and the prepared assay sample within the reaction vessel 23 is supplied to the detection unit 3 by controlling these pumps and valves. The detection unit 3 is provided with a flow cell 30 through which flows the assay sample, semiconductor laser light source 33 for irradiating an assay sample within the flow cell with laser light, photodiode 34 for detecting the forward scattered light emitted from the particles in the assay sample irradiated by the laser light, and a photomultiplier tube 35 for detecting the fluorescent light emitted from the particles in the assay sample irradiated by laser light. FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of the detection unit 3. The flow cell 30 is a tube through which flows an assay sample prepared by the sample preparation unit 2 and a sheath fluid supplied from a sheath fluid container not shown in the drawing. The sheath fluid flows so as to surround the flow of the assay sample when the assay sample flows through the flow cell 30. The sheath fluid is introduced into the flow cell 30 through a sheath fluid inlet 31. The assay sample is discharged from a sample nozzle 32 into the center of the sheath fluid flow within the flow cell 30. In this way the assay sample is surrounded by the sheath fluid within the flow cell 30, so as to flow in a narrowly restricted state. Furthermore, the detection unit 3 is provided with a light source 33 for irradiating an assay sample flowing through the flow cell 30 with laser light, and a photodiode 34 and photomultiplier tube 35 for respectively receiving the forward scattered light and fluorescent light emitted from the particles within the assay sample irradiated by the laser light. The light source 33 is a red color semiconductor laser light source, which emits a laser beam at a wavelength of 633 nm. The semiconductor light source is advantageous inasmuch as it is compact compared to an argon ion laser light source, and has a long generating service life. A condenser lens 36 is arranged on the optical axis between the light source 33 and the flow cell 30, and a converging lens 37a and pinhole 38a are arranged on the optical axis between the flow cell 30 and the photodiode 34. A converging lens 37b, optical filter 39, and pinhole 38b are arranged on the optical axis between the flow cell 30 and the photomultiplier tube 35. The photodiode 34 outputs electrical signals (forward scattered light signals) corresponding to the intensity of the received forward scattered light. Furthermore, the photomultiplier tube 35 outputs electrical signals (fluorescent light signals) corresponding to the intensity of the received fluorescent light. The forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals obtained by the detection unit 3 are transmitted to the control unit 4. The control unit 4 is provided with a microcomputer 40 which includes a central processing unit 400 and a memory 401, a control circuit 41 for controlling the operation of each unit of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1, and a signal processing circuit 42 for subjecting the forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals sent from the detection unit 3 to a noise elimination process and extracting the required data. Stored in the memory 401 are control programs for controlling the operation of each part of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 through the control circuit 41 and executing the series of assay operations, and analysis programs for analyzing the extracted data processed by the signal processing circuit 42 and counting the immature platelets and mature platelets contained in the specimen. The analysis results obtained by the analysis program are output to the liquid crystal touch panel 10 provided on the front of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. The operation of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 is described below. FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing the essential operation of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. First, the power supply of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 is turned ON by an operator. This operation starts the control program stored in the memory 401 of the control unit 4, which thereafter controls the operation of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. Then, as shown in FIG. 4, when the tip of the probe 12 has been inserted below the surface of the specimen fluid accommodated in the specimen container, the operator presses the start switch 11 (S1). In this way each step, including the assay sample preparation (S2), optical information detection (S3), analysis (S4), and output (S5), is automatically and sequentially executed in the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. The operations performed in each unit of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 in steps S2, S3, S4, and S5 are described below. Assay Sample Preparation (S2) In S2, the sample preparation unit 2 is controlled to prepare an assay sample from the specimen and predetermined reagents. As shown in FIG. 4, when the tip of the probe 12 has been inserted below the surface of the specimen fluid accommodated in the specimen container, the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 suctions the specimen in the specimen container from the tip of the probe 12. From the suctioned specimen, 4.5 &#x3bc;L of the specimen is discharged into the reaction vessel 23 of the sample preparation unit 2 through a tube. Then, 0.8955 mL of dilution fluid is supplied from the dilution fluid container 21 to the reaction vessel 23 through a tube, and the specimen is diluted. Next, 18 &#x3bc;L of staining fluid is supplied from the staining fluid container 22 to the reaction vessel 23 through a tube. Thereafter, the fluid temperature is maintained at 40&#xb0; C. while the fluids are mixed for 31 seconds to stain the diluted specimen. The staining fluid used includes a polymethene fluorescent dye represented by the structural formula below. This fluorescent dye possesses the property of producing fluorescence when excited by a laser light having a wavelength of approximately 633 nm. That is, fluorescence is excited by the red color laser light emitted from the light source 33 of the detection unit 3. This fluorescent dye has a further property of bonding with RNA in cells. Therefore, a difference in stainability occurs between cells having a large RNA content (for example, immature platelets) and cells having a low RNA content (for example, mature platelets), such that there is also a difference in the intensities of the fluorescence detected in S3, which is described later. Optical Information Detection (S3) In S3, flow cytometery is used to detect the forward scattered light and fluorescent light as optical information from each particle in the assay sample fluid. First, the sheath fluid accommodated within a sheath fluid container not shown in the drawing is introduced into the flow cell 30 through a tube, so as to flow. Then, a prepared assay sample is sent to the flow cell 30 from the reaction vessel 23 of the sample preparation unit 2, and discharged into the flow cell 30 through the sample nozzle 32. In this way the assay sample is surrounded in the sheath fluid within the flow cell 30, and flows in a narrowly restricted state. Then, the light source 33 is actuated, and the emitted laser light irradiates the assay sample flowing through the flow cell 30. The laser light emitted from the laser light source 33 is converged on the flow cell 30 by the condenser lens 36. The forward scattered light emitted from the particles in the assay sample irradiated by the laser light is focused by the converging lens 37a, and enters the photodiode 34 through the pinhole 38a. The fluorescent light emitted from the particles in the assay sample irradiated by the laser light is focused by the converging lens 37b, and enters the photomultiplier tube 35 through the optical filter 39 and pinhole 38b. The photodiode 34 and photomultiplier tube 35 respectively output forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals. These electrical signals are transmitted to the control unit 4. The intensity of the forward scatter light signal (intensity of the forward scattered light) is information which reflects the size of the cells, such that the larger the cell, the greater is the obtained forward scattered light intensity. The intensity of the fluorescent light (fluorescent light intensity) is information which reflects the degree of fluorescent staining of the cell. That is, in the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 of the present embodiment of the present invention which uses a staining reagent that contains a fluorescent dye having the property of bonding with the RNA within the cells, the greater the RNA content of the cell, the higher is the fluorescent intensity. S4 (Analysis) In S4, the forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals input from the detection unit 3 are processed and analyzed in the control unit 4. First, the forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals are input to the signal processing circuit 42. The signal processing circuit 42 removes noise signals from the forward scattered light signals and fluorescent light signals, and obtains forward scattered light data and fluorescent light data corresponding to each particle. The data are input to the microcomputer 40. The microcomputer 40 starts the analysis program stored in the memory 401, and analyzes the data input from the signal processing circuit 42. The flow of the analysis program is described below based on FIG. 6. S41: Forward scattered light data and fluorescent light data corresponding to each particle in the assay sample are acquired from the signal control circuit 42. S42: The forward scattered light intensity and fluorescent light intensity of each particle in the assay sample is calculated based on the data acquired in S41. S43: Two-dimensional coordinates are developed using the forward scattered light intensity and fluorescent light intensity as axes. Then, dots are placed on the coordinate positions corresponding to the forward scattered light intensity and fluorescent light intensity of each particle in the assay sample calculated in S42. In this way a two-dimensional scattergram is prepared using the forward scattered light intensity and fluorescent light intensity as parameters. S44: The region IP in which the immature platelets appear and the region MP in which the mature platelets appear are set on the two-dimensional scattergram prepared in S43. The region IP and region MP have been experimentally determined by measuring the forward scattered light intensity and fluorescent light intensity from assay samples containing cells confirmed beforehand to be mature platelets and cells confirmed beforehand to be immature platelets by microscopic examination and the like. In this way the coordinate data of the IP region and MP region determined beforehand are stored in the memory 401, and read by the analysis program in S44 so as to be applied to the two-dimensional scattergram. S45: The number of dots which appear in the respective the region IP and the region MP set in S44 is counted. The number of dots appearing in the region IP represents the number of immature platelets in the sample, and the number of dots appearing in the region MP represents the number of mature platelets in the specimen. S46: The total number of immature platelets and mature platelets determined in S45 (total platelets) is determined. Then, the number of immature platelets is divided by the determined total number of platelets. In this way the percentage of immature platelets is determined (percentage of immature platelets=number of immature platelets/(number of immature platelets+number of mature platelets)). S47: the percentage of immature platelets determined in S46 is compared to a predetermined value. When the percentage of immature platelets is lower than the predetermined value, the routine continues to S48. When the percentage of immature platelets is higher than the predetermined value, the routine continues to S49. The predetermined value compared to the percentage of immature platelets in S47 is stored beforehand in the memory 401. This predetermined value is read by the analysis program in S47, and compared to the percentage of immature platelets determined in the assay of the specimen. When the percentage of immature platelets exceeds the predetermined value, the possibility of a specific disease (in this case, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)) is suggested by outputting a warning to the operator of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 in a manner described later. S48: The previously prepared two-dimensional scattergram, determined number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets are stored in the memory 401 and prepared as output data for outputting to the liquid crystal touch panel 10 in S5 (output) described later. S49: A warning summarizing the previously prepared two-dimensional scattergram, determined number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, percentage of immature platelets, and that the percentage of immature platelets exceeds the predetermined value is stored in the memory 401 and output data are prepared for outputting to the liquid crystal touch panel 10 in step S5 (output) described later. An example of the two-dimensional scattergram prepared in S43 and S44 is shown in FIG. 7. This two-dimensional scattergram plots the forward scattered light intensity on the vertical axis, and the fluorescent light intensity on the horizontal axis. The region IP in which the immature platelets appear, and the region MP in which the mature platelets appear, are set. The immature platelets have a greater RNA content within the cell than do mature platelets, and they are larger than the mature platelets. Therefore, the region IP is set at a higher position of forward scattered light and fluorescent light intensities compared to the region MP. S5 (Output) The control unit 4 outputs the data prepared in S48 and S49 and stored in the memory 401 in S4 (analysis) to the liquid crystal touch panel 10. FIG. 13 shows the situation when the data stored in the memory 401 is output to the liquid crystal touch panel 10. The prepared two-dimensional scattergram, determined number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets are displayed on the liquid crystal touch panel 10. When the comparison of the percentage of immature platelets and the predetermined value results in the percentage of immature platelets being a value higher than the predetermined value, a warning indicating that there is a high possibility that the assayed specimen is from a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is displayed together with the prepared two-dimensional scattergram, determined number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets. FIG. 13 also shows the situation when a warning is output. ASSAY RESULT EXAMPLE 1 FIG. 7 is a two-dimensional scattergram resulting from assaying blood collected from a healthy subject using the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 described above. Furthermore, FIG. 8 is a two-dimensional scattergram resulting from assaying blood collected from a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) using the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. FIG. 9 is a two-dimensional scattergram resulting from assaying blood collected from a patient with aplastic anemia (AA) using the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1. Both ITP and AA are diseases having a reduced platelet count. Each of the two-dimensional scattergrams is analyzed in the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1, and the acquired number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 No. immature No. mature Percentage platelets platelets immature (&#xd7;109/L) (&#xd7;109/L) platelets (%) Healthy subject (FIG. 7) 4.9 210.1 2.3 ITP patient (FIG. 8) 16.1 85.9 15.8 AA patient (FIG. 9) 1.9 28.1 6.3 From Table 1 and FIGS. 7 and 8 it can be understood that ITP patients have more immature platelets in the blood than do healthy subjects. This condition is thought to be a result of elevated production of immature platelets in ITP patients, which causes platelets in an immature state to appear in peripheral blood. Although a slight elevation in the percentage of immature platelets is observed AA patients compared to healthy subjects in Table 1, a comparison of FIGS. 8 and 9 reveal that the strong presence of immature platelets emitting a fluorescent light observed in ITP patients is not seen in AA patients. In this way the two-dimensional scattergram, number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets prepared by the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 provide useful information which allows discrimination between ITP and AA, which are diseases with reduced platelet levels. ASSAY RESULT EXAMPLE 2 FIG. 10 is a graph showing the percentage of immature platelets in blood specimens collected from 18 healthy subjects, 22 ITP patients, and 6 AA patients using the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1, as differentiated by each type of subject and disease. ITP patients showed significantly higher values for the percentage of immature platelets. From this information it is understood that the percentage of immature platelets obtained by the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 is useful in discriminating ITP. ASSAY RESULT EXAMPLE 3 FIGS. 11 and 12 are two-dimensional scattergrams prepared by the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 from blood collected from a patient with hematopoietic tumor. FIG. 11 shows the result of assay of blood collected from the aforesaid patient in the nadir stage of chemotherapy. FIG. 12 shows the result of the assay of blood collected from the aforesaid patient after bone marrow transplantation following continuous chemotherapy when the number of immature platelets has increased to a maximum after transplantation. Each two-dimensional scattergram was analyzed in the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1, and the calculated number of immature platelets, number of mature platelets, and percentage of immature platelets are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 No. immature No. mature Percentage platelets platelets immature platelets (&#xd7;109/L) (&#xd7;109/L) (%) Nadir stage 0.3 22.7 1.3 (FIG. 11) Max No. immature 1.4 10.6 11.7 platelets stage FIG. 12) It is clear from FIGS. 11 and 12 that immature platelets were conspicuously absent in the specimen from the patient in the nadir stage of continuous chemotherapy. This condition is thought to reflect the reduced platelet production function in patients in the nadir stage of chemotherapy which results in inhibited marrow function and reduced platelet production. The fluorescent dye used in the present invention is not limited to the fluorescent dye used in the previously described embodiment, and may be another fluorescent dye insofar as the dye is excitable by laser light from a semiconductor light source and produces a difference in stainability between immature platelets and mature platelets, that is, the fluorescent dye is capable of binding with the RNA contained within a cell so as to stain the cell. Furthermore, the fluorescent dye used with the red color semiconductor laser in the previously described embodiment is not limited to the fluorescent dye represented in the aforesaid embodiment, and may be, for example, a fluorescent dye represented by the structural formula below. In the formula, R1 represents a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group; R2 and R3 respectively represent a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower alkoxy group; R4 represents a hydrogen atom, acyl group, or lower alkyl group, R5 represents a hydrogen atom or substituted lower alkyl group; Z represents a sulfur atom, oxygen atom, or one or two lower alkyl group-substituted carbon atom; n represents 1 or 2; and X represents an anion. The lower alkyl group in R1 in the formula means an alkyl group having branched chain or straight chain of 1-6 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl, among which methyl and ethyl are most desirable. The lower alkyl groups in R2 and R3 are identical, and a lower alkoxy group means an alkoxy group having 1-6 carbon atoms, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and the like, among which methoxy and ethoxy are desirable. R2 and R3 are most desirably hydrogen atoms. The acyl group in R4 is desirably an acyl group derived from aliphatic carboxylic acid, for example, acetyl, propionyl and the like, and among which an acetyl group is most desirable. Furthermore, the lower alkyl group is identical to that described above. The lower alkyl group in R5 is identical to that described above, and in the case of a substituted lower alkyl group, a lower alkyl group with a substituted hydrogen atom, such as 1-3 hydroxyl groups, halogen atoms (for example, fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, iodine atom) and the like, among which a methyl group or ethyl group substituted by one hydroxyl group is desirable. The lower alkyl group in Z is identical to that described above, and a sulfur atom is desirable as Z. The anion in X may be a halogen ion (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine ion), halogenated boron (BF4-, BCl4-, BBr4- and the like), phosphided compound ion, halogen oxy-acid ion, fluorosulfonic acid ion, methylsulfonic acid ion, tetraphenylboron compound ions having halogen or an alkyl radical with halogen as a substitute radical in an aromatic ring and the like. Among these, bromine ion or BF4- is most desirable. Although the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1 classifies and counts the immature platelets and mature platelets in a specimen (whole blood) in the previously described embodiment, other types of particles contained in a specimen also may be classified and counted. For example red blood cells and reticulocytes may be classified and counted as the aforesaid particles. FIG. 14 is a two-dimensional scattergram obtained by assaying a blood specimen using the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1; in this case, in addition to the region IP in which reticulated platelets appear, and the region MP in which mature platelets appear, a region RBC in which red blood cells appear and a region RET in which reticulocytes appear are also shown. In this case, the coordinate data of the region RBC and region RET are stored in the memory 401 of the apparatus for measuring immature platelets 1, and the analysis program in S44 reads the coordinate data of the region RBC and the region RET together with the coordinate data of the region IP and region MP so as to apply all the data to the two-dimensional scattergram. The reagents of the staining fluid and dilution fluid used in the present embodiment are identical to those of the previously described embodiment. In the scattergram of FIG. 14, the region RBC and region RET are set at positions having greater forward scattered light intensity than the region IP and region MP. This condition is set because the red blood cells and reticulocytes are larger than the immature platelets and mature platelets. The region RET is set at a position of greater fluorescent light intensity than the region RBC. This condition is set because the reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells, have RNA within the cells, and are more readily fluorescently stained than the mature red blood cells, which do not have RNA within the cells. In the present embodiment, not only are the reticulated platelets and mature platelets classified and counted, the red blood cells and reticulocytes are also classified and counted. The present invention described above discriminates and counts immature platelets and mature platelets using a fluorescent dye which is excited by a semiconductor laser and which produces different staining properties between immature platelets and mature platelets. Therefore, the present invention provides an apparatus for measuring immature platelets capable of using a semiconductor laser as a light source which is less expensive and more compact than a conventional argon ion laser light source. In this way the apparatus for measuring immature platelets is easily rendered more compact. The foregoing detailed description and accompanying drawings have been provided by way of explanation and illustration, and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Many variations in the presently preferred embodiments illustrated herein will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, and remain within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.\",\n          \"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

It also describes a mechanism to eliminate some of the clutter present on many conventional travel websites, as well as give the travel agent an opportunity to avoid some of the GDS fees and thereby provide a discount to consumers. It should be noted that although solely for convenience, the discussion herein is primarily in terms of interfacing to the Galileo GDS, the invention is equally applicable to interfacing to other GDSs, such as WorldSpan&#x2122;, Amadeus&#x2122;, etc. Alternatively, in addition to interfacing with just one GDS, the invention can work with all the GDSs, or with a subset of the GDSs. Conscious of the cost of the GDS, the airlines would prefer to remove the intermediary altogether. This has resulted in virtually all of the large airlines having their own central reservation systems, to which the consumer has direct access through the Internet. Similarly, hotels and car rental agencies would like to eliminate the middleman. With that in mind, in one preferred embodiment, which is illustrated in FIG. 1, discussed further below, the broad solution requirements/preferences include the following: 1. Use of Microsoft .NET approach. 2. Interface with Galileo's GDS (or another GDS) using XML Select for Air (an Internet booking engine for flights). 3. Merge Product Management System (discussed below) as part of the new solution. 4. Interface with third party suppliers using XML, such as: World Choice Travel (Internet Booking Engine for Hotels, discussed below), and TrustMarque Payment Gateway (discussed below) 5. Reduce third party development costs 6. Reduce time to market (from idea concept to full implementation) 7. Build Private Fares Database and incorporate it as part of the solution to support &#x201c;special&#x201d; fares by agents 8. Allow default partners in each market, but provide for multiple agents supporting single board points 9. Allow for airline offices to ticket their own segments (bookings to go directly to their offices and not to the agent) 10. Provide &#x201c;class driven&#x201d; search using Super Best Buy 11. Provide customized websites 12. Provide for FFP (frequent flyer program) driven search 13. Provide for Airline-specific search 14. Provide a tracking mechanism for packages referred on myTravelChannel to internal partners (i.e., Package Quotation System, or PQS, discussed below) In addition to a full business-to-consumer solution, the following additional components, discussed below, are offered in the solution: 1. Internet booking engine for Hotels using Galileo or other GDSs 2. Internet booking engine for car vendors using Galileo or other GDSs (e.g., Holiday Autos) 3. Product Management System 4. Creation and customization of agent websites via SiteMaster 6.0 5. Discounter Model 6. myFareWatcher 7. Deposit Model 8. Full system administration on Super/Country/City/Agent/User/Corporate levels using the Product Management System (PMS) 9. Corporate Booking Engine 10. Flight Schedules 11. Cancellations of Live PNR's (Passenger Name Records, i.e., booking numbers assigned to each booking) from Galileo 12. Retrieval of Live PNR's from Galileo 13. Creation of mixed type PNR's (single PNR that holds Air, Car and Hotel information) 14. Customized Branded Websites 15.

Internet Booking Engine for all hotels on Galileo 3. Internet Booking Engine for all hotels on USA Hotel Guide via World Choice Travel 4. Internet Booking Engine for all car vendors on Galileo 5. Secure online credit card transaction processing with risks analysis using TrustMarque/Natwest solution 6. Product Management System (PMS), which includes: a. Packages Management b. SiteMaster c. Private Fares d. Customers Management e. Corporate Booking f Workflow g. Discounter h. Deposit Model 7. MIS/CRM (customer relationship management) Data 8. Database of registered users In an exemplary embodiment, the solution is written using the following languages: ASP.NET; VB.NET; COM; JavaScript; VBScript; XML; T-SQL; and HTML. II. Solution Architecture The overall architecture is shown in FIG. 1, and includes three layers: a Presentation and Application Layer 101, a Business Logic and Data Access Layer 102 (hereafter, &#x201c;Business Logic Layer&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;Business Logic&#x201d;, which generally resides at a host site, such as 220 in FIG. 2), and a Datastore Layer 103. Each of these layers includes a number of components, as shown in FIG. 1. The Presentation and Application Layer 101 includes graphics/images/ASPX files and Code Behind files, which are all used to process and render processed information to the end client, and to collect, validate and pass information from the end client to the Business Logic Layer 102 for processing. In other words, layer 101 is responsible for direct interaction with the end client. The Presentation and Application Layer 101 also includes the myTravelChannel.com component 110, the SafarEZ business to consumer presentation component 111, the Product Management System (PMS) component 112, and a Private Fares component 113. The Presentation &#x26; Application Layer 101 is the front-end interface of the Business Logic &#x26; Data Access Layer 102. This interface includes pages, forms, buttons, images, datalists, datagrids and other controls used in presentation of data to the end-user. The Presentation &#x26; Application Layer 101 can include two sub-layers (not shown in the figures), which are: 1. Presentation Code (ASPX, ASCX and HTML files) 2. Code Behind (VB files) The presentation code includes pages that contain elements of display such as forms, images, buttons, etc., which are used for visual and data collection purposes. Code Behind layer is code that interfaces the Presentation and Application Layer 101 with the Business Logic &#x26; Data Access Layer 102 and passes information between these layers for retrieval/processing/storing purposes. It also defines behavior of controls and elements within the Presentation and Application Layer 101 based on the content passed from and to the Business Logic Layer 102. This layer also includes all the presentation code/Code Behind for the following applications: 1. myTravelChannel.com 110 2. SafarEZ B2C 111 3. Product Management System 112 4. Private Fares 113 myTravelChannel.com 110 is an application, within the Presentation &#x26; Application Layer, that includes a series of ASPX pages, HTML pages, ASCX Controls, Images, and Cascading Style Sheets. It belongs to a namespace called TravelChannel and can include two separate entities, for example, Arabic and English. Using XML Select, the interface to the Galileo GDS 207 is established, to access and book live inventory for flights, hotels and cars. Using XML SOAP (simple object access protocol), the interface to the USA Hotel Guide's online inventory management system is performed, to access/book additional hotel deals and live hotel. Using XML SOAP, the interface to the TrustMarque Payment Gateway 163 is performed, to process online transactions and analyze the risk associated with those transactions. (It will be appreciated that although the discussion in this text is primarily in terms of TrustMarque Payment Gateway, the invention is not limited to the Trust Marque Payment Gateway, and other payment gateways may be used, for example, a BIBIT payment gateway, see, e.g., http://www.bibit.com/). The following sections/components can be included in the myTravelChannel 110 application: Cruises, Hotels, Packages, Events, Flights, Partners, Cars, Controls, Utilities. These are discussed further below. The Business Logic Layer 102 acts as a buffer between the Datastore Layer 103 and the Presentation &#x26; Application Layer 101. It retrieves processes and stores data that is being passed between the Presentation &#x26; Application Layer 101 and Datastore Layer 103. It applies predefined business rules to any proposed transaction. The Business Logic Layer 102 includes the various components for interfacing with the appropriate databases and external data sources. For example, the Business Logic Layer 102 includes interface modules, such as modules for interfacing to flights databases (114), interfacing to flight schedules database(s) 136, interfacing to hotels databases (115), interfacing to MIS (116), interfacing to car rental databases (121), interfacing to packages databases (122), and interfacing to discounter databases (117). The Business Logic Layer 102 also includes interface modules for interfacing to an SQL provider (123), myFareWatcher 124, delivery options 125, customer manager 126, an interface to any external/corporate databases (127), TrustMarque provider 128, XML Select provider 129, and a World Choice Travel provider 130. Administrative modules include SiteMaster 1.0 (134) (a website management module), an error handing module 135, and an administrator's manager module 131. Other modules link to destination guides database (137), AME Info News (138), private fares (139), two robots module a myFareRobot 133, a PQS robot 132, discussed further below. The Datastore Layer 103 is used to get the relevant data, based on the transaction requirement, from one and/or multiple data sources that provide data to the solution. The Datastore Layer 103 includes links to the Galileo database 160 (see also Galileo data center 207 in FIG. 2), links to World Choice Travel 162, links to TrustMarque Payment Gateway 163, links to an MIS database 164, to a Private Fares database 165 and to an SQL Server 2000 database (myFareWatcher database) 161. III. Hosting The solution is currently hosted by a hosting industry provider Interland. (See http://www.interland.com/ and discussion of FIG. 2 below, although the invention is not limited to this hosting scheme). The solution consists of two servers (one IIS XML server and one SQL server) and a dedicated firewall. The maintenance of the servers can be outsourced to Interland, while full administrative access to both servers is retained through the Internet using Terminal Services Clients. As further shown in FIG. 2, the business solution, in one example, includes a number of interconnected elements provided by different suppliers. For example, one exemplary supplier is Interland 208, which includes a connection line 210 to a router 212, an Ethernet 213, an IIS XML server 214, an SQL server 215, a LAN 220, and a firewall 216. The Interland office 208 is connected through an AT&#x26;T frame relay network 209 to a data center 207, which includes another router 217, an Ethernet 218, and a Galileo host CRS complex 219 (the Galileo database 160 typically resides there). The data center 207 is connected using virtual private network 205 to the Internet 201, and through the Internet to World Choice Travel database 162 (using a firewall 204). There is also a connection to a TrustMarque Payment Gateway database 163 using XML SOAP protocol 203. With the exception of packages, which are built using the Product Management System 112, the live inventory comes from third party data sources, such as Galileo GDS 207, World Choice Travel 162, and TrustMarque Payment Gateway 163. IV. Product Management System The Product Management System (PMS) 112 allows management of the following: 1. Agent Profiles 2. Agent Packages 3. Agent Discounts 4. Agent Private Fares 5. Agent Websites 6. Multiple agents per single board point 7. Airline specific fulfillment The Product Management System 112 allows agents to manage packages (holiday vacations) online and allows site administrators to manage content/offering provided to both agents and visitors of the site. The Product Management System 112 includes the following sections: (1) Packages, (2) Private Fares, (3) Discounter, (4) Agents, (5) Administrators, (6) Components, (7) Component Groups, (8) Image Bank, (9) Statistics, (10) Activity Log, and (10) Types. Private fares are typically offered to a particular agent by an airline. Private fares may be route specific (in other words, &#x201c;this route and that route are discounted by 5% on airline X between origin A and destination B&#x201d;), or on any other route that airline X flies or on any particular route, or on a particular airline generally. Normally, the consumer does not see private fairs. myTravelChannel 110 gives access to the consumer for private fares, in effect allowing the consumer to become his own travel agent. The Packages module 122 allows the agents to manage their packages on various sites that they use to distribute their content. The agents use the Packages section to view, insert, update, delete and overall manage the packages that they distribute on one or many travel portals. Every package managed by the agents includes the following information: Package Type: This is an indicator of what type/kind a package is. It is a dynamic list managed by administrators, which provides options such as: Holiday Package, Cruise Package, Event Package, etc. Package Validity Dates: These are two dates between which the agent wishes to show his package as available to the end users. If the dates specified here match the users search criteria, the package is shown to the user as available for a booking request. Package Image: From a drop down list, an agent is able to select one of X images which they have uploaded into their image bank to associate with this package. Customizability: With this option, the agent specifies if the package is customizable or not. Customizable package enables the user to remove the original components specified by the agent as part of the package and add new ones. It enables the user to use an existing package uploaded by the agent as a template for building a customized package request. Duration: Indicates the length/duration of the package. It is usually referred to in number of nights. Reference: This field is used by the agent to specify a reference number (alphanumeric) which will uniquely identify this package in their organization. This could be either an existing reference number already used by the agent in the offline world for this package or a new reference number/indicator. Title: This field is used to &#x201c;Name&#x201d; a package. This is used to identify the package to the end user (e.g., &#x201c;enjoy a weekend escape in London&#x201d;). Summary: describes a package in a few sentences. This is used as a preview of what the package contains and is displayed to the user in a search result screen where multiple packages are shown as options to the end user. Description: This is used to fully describe what the package contains. Provided is a Rich Text Box Editor that allows the agent to use all the functionality usually provided by products such as Microsoft Word. The Agent by using this field is able to highlight certain features of the package, insert outside links, or simply copy-paste a ready made brochure in a DTP format. The user sees the information entered in this field when he/she selects a specific package. The Product Management System 112 also provides the agents with a set of components that allows them to further describe their package. The end-user uses these same components to define his/her preferences (search criteria) which will then be used to find relevant packages. These components are grouped under &#x201c;Component Groups&#x201d; which are used to group those components of the same nature under individual headings. Examples of Component Groups are: Package Type, Accommodation, Special Requests, etc. Examples of components that belong to such groups are: Package Type Group would typically contain components such as Romantic, Honeymoon, Adventure, etc. Accommodation Group would typically contain components such as Villa Accommodation, Hotel Accommodation, Resort, etc. Component Groups and their subsequent components are defined and managed via Product Management System 112 by Administrators, who can edit/add/delete groups and components on agent requests. The selection of components by the end user is used to compare those components requested and those available in a certain package, which are used to calculate a search criteria match. Special Offer: This field indicates whether this package is on special offer. Origin/Destination/Pricing/Distribution: A package entered into the Product Management System 112 normally needs to have a point of origin and a destination point. The agents can use IATA Standard city codes, which the system then converts to cities and maps the entered codes to countries. With each package, an agent is able to specify an unlimited number of origin/destination points with each having an individual price and a distribution point. For example: If an agent has a package entitled &#x201c;Weekend Escape to London,&#x201d; he/she can specify in this section that this package, if consumed from Dubai will cost $200, but if consumed from Kuwait will cost $130. In addition to the above, the agent can also specify a distribution channel for the origin/destination/pricing combination. Weekend Escape to London from Dubai would cost $200 on myTravelChannel.com 110 while the same package, if distributed on a different portal, could cost $230. Times Viewed: This is an indicator (counter) that tells the agent how many times a specific package has been selected by the visitor. It is an indicator that is known as a LOOK ratio of the package. Times Booked: This indicator provides the agent with the information on how many times a specific package has been booked by the visitors. Together with Times Viewed indicator agents are able to view LOOK to BOOK ratio on every package in the system. DOE: Date of Entry is the date when the package was created by an agent. Approved: As part of quality control, every package that gets inserted into the system needs to be approved by a site administrator. This field indicates whether a specific package has been approved or not. An inserted package does not appear to site visitors until it has been approved. Approved On: This field indicates a date when the package has been approved. Approved By: This field indicates who has approved this package. Rejected: This is an indicator that specifies if the package has been rejected by a system administrator. Rejection Reason: This field provides a reason why the package has been rejected. This is a free text entry by an administrator explaining their reason why this package has not been approved and provides feedback to the agent on what they need to change in order to get their package approved. Rejected On: Provides a date when the package has last been rejected By using the PMS 112, agents are able to manage all their packages. They can edit packages, insert packages, delete packages, and promote package on various sites. Filtered views allow agents to quickly find packages based on their status (Expired, Deleted, Waiting For Approval, Rejected, etc.) and to find out how well their packages are doing on various websites. (&#x201c;Look to Book&#x201d; ratios). Most GDS charge a fee (currently, about $30) to process a booking for a hotel. If the middleman were eliminated, this would provide obvious benefits to the consumer, particularly, since the cost of the hotel when using the GDS databases must be at least the cost of the airfare, or higher. Tour operators normally strike deals with suppliers (i.e. hotels) and then sell the inventory to the travel agents. The approach of the Product Management System 112 is to start with a budget. The next step is to ask the consumer where he is traveling from. The next step is to ask the consumer where he is traveling to. The next step is to ask the consumer for the dates of travel. The next step is to define the type of package (a cruise, romantic vacation, family vacation, adventure, etc.). The next step is to specify the accommodations (a hotel, a villa, an apartment). The next step is to identify any add-ons (ski, water ski, climbing, hiking, etc.). Once the package characteristics are put together, then a search can be conducted. V. Package Approval Workflow Adding a new package: when an agent inserts a new package in the system, the package needs to go through a quality check control by designated system administrator before it can &#x201c;go live&#x201d; and be shown to site visitors. After a successful insertion of a package, the system sends an email to the system administrator informing them that a new package has been added and that it is waiting in their approval queue for review. At this point an agent who has inserted this package is also notified via email that their package has now been queued for approval. At this point, a system administrator logs on to the Product Management System 112 and reviews the package inserted into the system by an agent. The administrator has an option to either approve or reject a package. If the administrator decides to approve a package and clicks on an approve button, the package instantly becomes available to site visitors and the agent is informed via email that their package is now live. If, however, the administrator decides to reject a package, they have to provide a descriptive reason as to why a package has been rejected. This reason is then copied in an email that gets sent to the agent, informing them that their package has been rejected. In this case, the agent has an option to either amend the package using the feedback provided by an administrator in the reject reason or to delete a package. Editing an existing pre-approved package: when an agent decides to edit an existing package that has already been approved, they are warned that the package they are about to edit will be taken offline. Once the agent makes the changes to the package, the package's LIVE status (APPROVED) is then changed to indicate that the package is no longer available to the site visitors. A system administrator is then notified that a package inserted by the agent has been edited and the approval process repeats again. VI. Package Quotation System The Package Quotation System 132 (PQS) is a business process, system and method that provides a facilitation service between customer and supplier online in order to reach an agreement for a package online, the payment of which will be conducted offline when the customer collects or receives their travel documents. It includes customer interaction with the agent online and the whole negotiation/customization process by which the agent caters to additional customer's needs and the business gets visibility of all the transactions that happen with the customer. It allows the business to control package sales and ensure customer service on a much more detailed level. The Package Quotation System 132 enables the agents to manage package booking requests created by site visitors for their packages. When a visitor selects an agent's package or creates a customized package request, they are presented with a form that, in addition to the basic contact information, requests the visitor to provide specific package details whilst making a package quotation request. The visitor specifies preferences such as travel dates, additional components and can also provide feedback on the package in a special &#x201c;Additional Information&#x201d; box provided as part of the package quotation request form. Once the visitor submits the request, an agent is then informed via email that there has been a package quotation request for one of their packages. By logging on to PMS 112 and navigating to packages section, the agent is presented with the &#x201c;Package Requests&#x201d; option. In the package requests section, the agent is able to view all package requests that have been submitted. Each package request has the following information: Package Reference: indicates the reference number for a package for which the quotation request has been made. Request Date and Time: indicates the date and time when the request was made. Package Title: title of the package for which the request was made. Request Status: indicates the current status of each request. Request status can have the following options: Respond: package request has not yet been responded to. Waiting for customer: the agent has responded back to the customer with a quotation, and the request originator now needs to either accept or reject the quotation. Not Available: the agent has responded to this package request and has indicated to the visitor that the package is no longer available. Rejected: the request originator has rejected the offer made in the package quotation. Accepted: The visitor has accepted the offer made in the quotation by an agent. Each agent has, for example, a 48 hour period to respond to each package request before the system starts to send email reminders that they have not responded to the customer within an agreed timescale. The reminder is also sent to the system administrator informing them that the visitor is waiting for more than the advertised 48 hours to receive his/her package quote from the agent VII. Building a Package Quotation Once a package request has been submitted by a site visitor, the agent is informed via email that a new request for a package quotation has been inserted in their requests queue. By logging on to PMS 112, the agent navigates to the package requests section and clicks on the &#x201c;Respond&#x201d; link located next to a request they wish to respond to. At this point, package quotation form is displayed to the agent. From this form, the agent is able to view the original package quotation request as well as the quotation response form. In this form, the agent can: 1. Specify whether a package request is available 2. Specify flight details of the package such as outbound/return journey airline, flight number, class of travel, additional comments, date of outbound journey, date of return journey, etc. 3. Specify accommodation details of this package such as hotel name, hotel location, room type, hotel amenities, additional information on hotel, whether airport transfer is included, etc. 4. Specify price per adult/child/infant 5. Specify the duration/cost of any additional components that the visitor has requested that are not part of the original package 6. Specify additional components the agent wishes to cross-sell or up sell to the visitor which are not part of the original package. 7. Provide additional information to the visitor for any part of the package The system then calculates the total amount for this quotation based on pricing specified by the agent for each of the sections that make up the quotation form, such as flights/accommodation/components. Once this form is submitted by the agent, the system sends an email back to the visitor informing him/her that their request has been responded to with a quotation, changes the request status to &#x201c;Waiting for customer,&#x201d; and informs the system administrator that the agent has responded to a visitor's request with a quotation. As part of the email sent to him/her, the system indicates to the visitor that they need to logon to a respective site and click on &#x201c;my Bookings&#x201d; where they will be able to see the package quotation generated by the agent based on their request. Once the visitor opens the package quotation, he/she is able to: 1. View their original request 2. View the package quotation (response) 3. Accept the package quotation 4. Reject the package quotation 5. Provide additional feedback to the agent On package quotation acceptance/rejection, the system performs the following tasks: 1. Notifies the agent of the visitor's response via email 2. Notifies the system administrator of the visitor's response 3. Changes the status of the request from &#x201c;Waiting for customer&#x201d; to either &#x201c;Accepted&#x201d; or &#x201c;Rejected&#x201d;. Thus, the PQS allows creation of a &#x201c;presentation grid&#x201d; that lists multiple packages by website. This is useful because different sites target different customer groups. For instance, website 1 may be targeted to the B2C market (business to consumer), while websites 2 and 3 may be targeted to the B2B (business to business) market. Once a package is built (and can include such things as cost, currency, origin, destination, dates available, etc.), it can then be placed on the selected websites: Site Package cost Website 1 Dubai-NY 1 $4700 Website 1 Kuwait-NY 1 $2700 Website 2 Dubai-NY 1 $4900 Website 3 Dubai-NY 2 $4500 With a grid such as shown above, the creator of the package can make different packages available to the travel agents based on, among other things, the targeted market. Note that in this example, website 1 (e.g., www.myTravelChannel.com) has deeper discounts than website 2 for the same package (for instance, due to volume, or due to the fact that it is willing to cut its commissions). Website 3 has a package with the same origin and destination, but may have more restrictions (not shown in this grid). Website 1 also has a Kuwait-NY package, which is different from the Dubai-NY 1 package only in the flight information. This permits the travel agent to quickly build the Dubai-NY package by having the passenger fly through Kuwait, assuming this makes financial sense and the passenger is willing to make an extra stop. VIII. Discounter In order to provide tactical offers to the site visitors, system administrators have the ability to discount flight routes on the site by a certain amount, expressed for example, in percentage value. By using the Discounter 117, the system administrator is able to create a discounted route. To create this route, the system administrator needs to enter the following: 1. Dates during which the discounting is applied (From-To) 2. Origin Point from which to discount fares (City Code) 3. Destination Point to which to discount fares (Country Code) 4. Discount which airline(s) 5. Applicable to Private Fares 6. Applicable to GDS (Published) Fares 7. Percent by which to discount fares With this option, the system administrator is able to create a discount as follows, for example: discount all private and published fares out of Dubai to Great Britain by 20% on (for example) all Emirates, British Airways and Lufthansa flights between first of Jan. 2003 and 1st of Mar. 2003. IX. myFareWatcher As a value added service to site visitors, myFareWatcher 124 provides information gathered across site(s) on seat availability and flight fares based on date range, price and tolerance limit. Airlines publish different fares for different markets to the GDSs for different dates. A typical scenario is that if someone wanted to travel from Dubai to London on 13th of May and return on 19th of May, they would get a fare of $300. However, if they were to travel on 12th of May and return on 20th of May, they would get a lower fare. This is due to airlines publishing different fares that include a certain set of rules that govern their amounts. These rules include seasons, distressed inventory, tactical offers, stay duration, etc. myFareWatcher 124 includes a robot program 133 that is started by the user in order to periodically query the relevant databases to either search for lower fares, or to search for availability if a particular flight desired by the consumer was unavailable during the initial search. The robot runs in the background, for example, once a day at midnight. The consumer can specify the budget and the flexibility in the budget (for example, up to 30% higher than the original fare offered to him if he wants a different flight). Phrased another way, myFareWatcher 124 is an application that allows collecting MIS data relevant to flight searches conducted on myTravelChannel.com 110 (and any number of other applications). Collected data is then analyzed and stored for later retrieval, and can then be used as: 1. An information tool for the users who wish to see what fares are available on certain sectors on various dates, so they can base their trip planning around the best fare. Users are informed of best fares via either (a) email or (b) as part of search results. Users additionally can specify criteria by which they will be informed of great deals. (i.e., if the user chooses to be alerted when someone finds a fare from DXB to LHR for $400 or less, only then will they be notified). 2. An information tool for the business owners that helps them analyze most popular routes for air segments which then helps the business to (a) better price their products and (b) build tactical offers that match the market demand. With myFareWatcher 124, the customer is provided with alternative dates on which the fares for the same travel sector might be lower. This is achieved with myFareWatcher 124 application, which monitors and stores all searches conducted on the site, their result and potential saving. For example, myFareWatcher 124 would record a search made by Traveler 1 which originated from Dubai and was going to London on 13th of May with a return date on 19th of May. It would record a lowest price of $300. Before displaying the search result to the visitor, myFareWatcher 124 checks the database for any previously recorded searches attempted for the same sector with a lower fare found. If myFareWatcher 124 finds a stored fare that is lower than $300 (for example, $200), it will display a notification to the visitor above the search results with an indication that if the visitor changes their travel dates to those specified in a previously recorded search executed earlier by a different user, they might have a potential saving of $100 (provided that the seats are still available, which the user can check by clicking on &#x201c;check availability&#x201d; option). In addition to the built-in display of myFareWatcher 124 as part of the search results, myFareWatcher 124 also enables the user to register and create email trigger criteria. By specifying in myFareWatcher 124 the route, trip type (one-way/return), fare and tolerance, the visitor will be in a position to receive an email as soon as someone finds a fare on the system that matches their criteria. For example, Traveler 3 registers with myFareWatcher 124 and specifies Dubai&#x2014;London return trip for $200 with 10% tolerance as their email trigger. When myFareWatcher 124 records a search that matches that criteria, it will automatically send an email to that visitor informing them of dates for which they can check the availability on the site in order to get their desired fare. With myFareWatcher 124, the solution will be searching for best fares on behalf of the users, even when the users are not. An attractive feature of the solution is that all the searches done by all the consumers can be stored in a local database (e.g., the myFareWatcher database 161). Thus, there is less need to constantly &#x201c;ping&#x201d; the GDS database 160, and prior searches by other customers can be reused. This is useful when a consumer specifies that in addition to a flight from origin A to destination B, and leaving on date X, returning on date Y, the consumer has some flexibility as to, for example, travel times, or travel dates. myFareWatcher 124 can search its own logs or other queries by other consumers, and provide the customer with additional options that may be cheaper. This has particular applicability to the leisure travel market where many consumers are willing to substantially change their itinerary in order to save money. Additionally, myFareWatcher 124 can help offer the consumer other travel dates and other fares, if the particular fare sought by the consumer is sold out. If the consumer does not confirm his purchase of the reserved booking within 48 hours, that booking is canceled. myTravelChannel.com 110 also allows for reducing the commission, and passing on the savings to the consumer. Frequently, the reduction in the commission may be made up through volume. X. Deposit Model and Cross Sell Together with the PMS 112, an intelligent way of cross selling products from one section of the website to another can use the Deposit Model and Cross Sell approach. In addition, the Deposit model allows the customer to pay only 10% (or some other specified percentage) of the total ticket value online, and settle the remaining amount with the agent at a later time. With the Discounter 117, a business can tactically discount routes rather than just individual flights. It is flexible enough to allow the business to specify the discounting of either/or/and any of the following 1. Airline specific 2. Route specific 3. Class specific 4. Fare type specific (e.g., Private vs. Published vs. All) 5. Origin point 6. Destination point In addition to public fares available through the GDS, such as Galileo GDS 207, there are also private fares available from Galileo GDS 207 (and other GDSs). The private fares may be, for example, corporate discounts from a particular airline to a particular corporation, or any other separate deals made between a provider (such as a hotel, an airline, a car rental company etc. and an organization) usually a business, or a corporation, etc. myTravelChannel.com 110 can compare its own private fares with the private fares available from Galileo GDS 207, to show the lowest fare to the consumer. In conventional websites, after conducting a search of the available fares, the consumer sees a number of fares, including some relatively low fares, many of which are not available to be booked. In other words, these are, in effect, phantom fares, because if a consumer were to try to actually book them, he would be either told that that fare is not available, or be redirected to a higher fare. myTravelChannel.com 110 provides the consumer only those fares that are actually available. myTravelChannel.com 110 can also, optionally, show the consumer other fares that are within 45% or some other designated percentage of the lowest fare. This is normally done with every search, without the need for consumer to make additional requests on the website. Thus, the process of booking a flight, from the consumer's perspective, involves only the following steps: 1. search 2. review results 3. book the flight 4. pay to reserve the flight. XI. Deposit model Instead of asking for the full fare in order to book the flight, myTravelChannel.com 110 can also (or instead) ask for a certain percentage of the fare in order to book the flight, for example, 10% or 15%. This is tantamount to a cancellation fee should the consumer ultimately decide not to buy the ticket. Until the consumer actually pays to book the fare, no booking number is created. Thus, because the consumer's credit card is debited before the flight is booked, there is no danger that, in between looking on the screen to see which fares are available and actually booking a particular fare, that booking will disappear or will become unavailable. Thus, there is no need for the airline to hold the inventory of &#x201c;booked fares&#x201d; for 30 minutes or 45 minutes, with the risk that a particular &#x201c;booked&#x201d;seat will not actually be purchased. Additionally, there is only a need to pay credit card and other charges on the booking amount (10% or 15%), while the commissions are based on the full amount paid for the ticket by the customer. This saves substantial amounts and third-party fees. It is worth noting that in some cases, extending the stay at the destination by one day can substantially lower the price of the ticket. For example purchasing the ticket seven days in advance, with a stay at the destination of at least seven days can be considerably cheaper than purchasing the ticket six days in advance for a six day stay. Thus, with the proper specification of the flexibility of the travel dates by the customer, myFareWatcher 124 can reuse the searches by other customers to offer additional low cost options to the consumer. With the above in mind, the process of booking various items, such as cruises, flights, hotels, etc., will be explained below with reference to FIGS. 3-8. XII. Booking Cruises The cruises module, which is part of the myTravel Channel application 120, includes ASPX pages that are used to display the flow for Cruises section of myTravelChannel. This section uses the Business Logic Layer 102 to call a package in the PMS 112 that have been tagged as a Cruise Package and follows the same flow in order to book cruises as does the Packages section. The booking flow is illustrated in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, the user 301 is shown a search form 330 for booking a cruise package, which he then fills out. If all the fields in the form 330 are completed validly (step 303), then the process proceeds to connect to the Business Logic Layer 102 using the Code Behind, so as to request packages that match the criteria specified by the user (step 305). If the search form 330 is not completed in a valid manner, the user 301 is shown an error message (step 304), and the search form 330 is redisplayed. After step 305, if there are results available (step 307), the process proceeds to processing the packages returned by the Business Logic Layer 120, sorting them, for example, by the lowest price first (step 308). If no results are available, the user 301 is informed that no results matching their criteria have been found, and a new search is suggested (step 306). The search form 330 is then redisplayed to the user. After step 308, once the packages returned by the Business Logic Layer 102 are processed, the results are formatted and displayed to the user 301, with the requests that the user 301 select one of the packages (step 309). Selected package details are then received from the PMS using the Business Logic Layer 102 (step 310). The selected package details are displayed to the user 301 (step 311). The user 301 is then asked if he wishes to book this package (step 312). If he does not, then the process ends (step 324). If the user 301 does want to book the package, then the user 301 is requested to authenticate himself (step 313). If the user 301 is not authenticated (step 314), then the user 301 is requested again to authenticate himself (returning to step 313). If the user 301 has validly authenticated himself, then the booking form 316 is displayed to the user 301 (step 315). If not all the fields in the form 316 are valid (step 317) then an error message is shown (step 318), again displaying the form 316. If all the fields in the form 316 are valid, then the process checks, using the Business Logic layer 102, if this request is to be processed using either PQS or email (step 319). If the request needs to be processed as a PQS request (step 320), then the PQS system is updated, and a new request is inserted (step 321). If the request is not processed as a PQS request, then an email is sent to the user 301 and to the travel agent, informing them of the next steps they need to take to complete this booking (step 322). The user 301 is then thanked for the booking, and the next steps are explained to the user 301 (step 323). The process then terminates at step 324. XIII. Booking Events This section includes ASPX pages and Code Behind that connects to the Business Logic &#x26; Data Access Layer 102 and provides a filtered search of packages in the Product Management System 112 that have been input as Events. The booking flow is illustrated in FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, in step 402, all the packages in the system that have been tagged as &#x201c;events&#x201d; are displayed to the user 301. In step 403, the user 301 selects a desired event out of the events that were presented to him, either on a page or using a drop down menu of all the events (step 403). In step 404, the system connects to the PMS 112 using Business Logic Layer 102, and retrieves all the details of the events selected by the user 301. If the user 301 does not wish to book this event (step 405), the process ends (step 406). If the user 301 does wish to book this event, in step 407, a booking form 408 is displayed to the user 301. The process then checks if all the fields in the form 408 have been validly completed (step 409). If they have not been validly completed, an error message is displayed (step 410), and the form 408 is redisplayed to the user 301. If the fields in the form 408 are validly completed, the process checks, using the Business Logic Layer 102, if this request needs to be processed using PQS or using email (step 411). If the request is a PQS request (step 412), the PQS system is updated, and a new request is inserted (step 413). The process then proceeds to step 414, sending an email to the user 301 and to the travel agent informing them of the next steps to be followed to complete this booking (step 414). If the request is not a PQS request in step 412, the process proceeds directly to step 414. In step 415, the user 301 is thanked for the booking, and the next steps are explained (step 415). The process then terminates at step 406. As an alternative, the solution can interface to ViaTour (a provider of package information and booking information) using an XML feed, see, e.g., http://www.viatour.com.au/. XIV. Booking Hotels This section contains ASPX pages and Code Behind that connect to the Business Logic Layer 102 and then via XML to World Choice Travel/USA Hotel Guide inventory system. The booking flow is illustrated in FIG. 5. As shown in FIG. 5, to book a hotel, the user 301 is shown a search form 501. If all the fields in the form 501 are validly completed by the user (step 502), then the process proceeds to connect to the Business Logic Layer 102 using the Code Behind, and requests the hotels from, for example, World Choice Travel 162, that match the criteria specified in the form 501 by the user 301 (step 507). If the form 501 is not validly filled out, an error message is shown (step 503), and the form of 501 is redisplayed. After step 507, if there are no results available (step 505), the process proceeds to inform the user 301 that no results have been found that match the user's criteria, and a new search can be suggested (step 506). The process can then return to display a new form 501. If, in step 505, results are available, the results are processed and sorted by, for example, the lowest price (step 530). The result will then be formatted and displayed to the user 301, requesting that he select one of them (step 508). Room rates are then received from World Choice Travel 162 for the selected hotel (step 509). The selected room rates are then displayed to the user 301 (step 510). The user 301 is then asked if he wishes to book a hotel room (step 511). If he does not, the process ends (step 514). If he does, then a booking form 529 is displayed to the user 301 (step 513). The process then checks if all the fields in the form 529 have been correctly filled out (step 516). If they have not, then an error message is shown (step 517) and the form 529 is redisplayed. If the fields in the form 529 have been validly filled out, then the process proceeds to send the booking information to World Choice Travel using the Business Logic Layer 102, through protocols such as XML, and gets a booking confirmation (step 518). An email is then sent to the user 301, providing him with the booking details and the confirmation code (step 519). The user 301 is then thanked for the booking, and all the information that was sent in the email is displayed, including a confirmation code (step 520). The process then ends at step 514. XV. Booking Packages This section contains ASPX pages and Code Behind that connects to Business Logic &#x26; Data Access Layer 102 and then to the SQL Database 161 and Product Management System 112 to retrieve and book packages in the system that match the user's search criteria. The booking flow is illustrated in FIG. 8. The packages section has a user front-end, which is part of the Presentation and Application Layer 101, that allows the user to search for packages that match his/her search criteria. The back-end connects to the Product Management System 112 and Package Quotation System 132 to manipulate data. As shown in FIG. 8, to book a package, the user 301 is shown a search form 801. Once the user 301 completes the form 801, the system checks if the fields in the form have been validly completed (step 802). If they have not been validly completed, an error message is shown (step 803), and the form 801 is redisplayed. If the fields have been validly completed, then the system connects to the Business Logic Layer 102 using the Code Behind, to request packages that match criteria that the user 301 specified (step 804). If there are no search results available (step 805), then the user 301 is informed of that fact, and a new search is suggested (step 806). The form 801 is then again displayed to the user 301. If results are available, then the packages that are returned by the Business Logic Layer 102 are processed and sorted, by the lowest price first (step 807). The results are formatted and displayed to the user 301, with a request that he select one package for booking (step 808). Details for the selected package are received from the PMS using the Business Logic Layer 102 (step 809). The details of the selected package are displayed to the user 301 (step 810). If the user 301 does not wish to book this package (step 811), the process terminates (step 814). If the user 301 does wish to book the package, he is requested to authenticate himself (step 812). If the user 301 is not then authenticated (step 813), he is again requested to authenticate himself (step 812). If the authentication is valid, a booking form 815 is displayed to the user 301 (step 823). The user 301 then fills out the form 815, and the process checks whether the user 301 filled all the fields in the form validly (step 816). If not, an error message is shown (step 817), and the form 815 is redisplayed to the user 301. If the fields in the form 815 have been filled out validly, the process checks, using the Business Logic Layer 102, if this request needs to be processed using the PQS or using email (step 818). If this is a PQS request (step 819), the PQS system is updated, and a new request is inserted (step 820). An email is then sent to the user 301 and to the travel agent informing them of the next steps they need to take in order to complete the booking (step 821). If this is not a PQS request in step 819, the process proceeds directly to step 821. The user 301 is then thanked for the booking, and the next steps in the process are explained to the user 301 (step 822). The process then terminates in step 814. XVI. Booking Flights This section contains ASPX pages, ASCX controls and relevant Code Behind to connect to Business Logic &#x26; Data Access Layer 102, PMS 112, TrustMarque 163 and SQL Server 2000 database 161 in order to allow the user to book a flight, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7A-7D. As shown in FIG. 6, upon the start of the booking process (601), the user begins a search using either a quick search or an advanced search option (step 602, see also discussion below). A holding page is displayed to the user (step 603). Here, the user has the option to provide search criteria, such as travel dates, airline, passenger information, etc., and this information is captured. The system then queries the Galileo GDS 207 database 160 and a Private Fares database 605 for availability of the fares, based on the criteria entered by the user (step 604). The results are returned by the Galileo GDS 207 database 160 and the Private Fares database 605 (step 606). Here, the system has an opportunity to &#x201c;grab&#x201d; the lowest fare, and store it in the database 161, together with a search criteria. The discounter 117 is then queried for applicable discounts (step 607). These discounts are applied to the search results and to the fares, as amended by the discount using the information from the discounter 117. The results are then parsed, and a &#x201c;no show&#x201d; rule is applied to the results, to filter out irrelevant fares, based on a percentage defined by the system administrator (step 610). The search results from the Galileo GDS 207 database and the Private Fares database 605 are cached into a server memory, and are tagged with a session ID (step 611). The holding page is removed, and the user is redirected to a results page (step 612). The Fare Watcher database 225 (which may be stored on the SQL server 215) is queried for fares that have been previously found by other searches, where the fares are lower than the lowest fare returned by Galileo GDS 207 database 160 and the Private Fares database 605, such that these results match the criteria selected by the user 301 for this session (step 613). The results from the Fare Watcher database 225 are parsed down to the myFareWatcher data grid, prior to displaying the results to the user (step 615). Results that have been previously cached are retrieved from the server, and are bound to the display data grid (step 616). Management and Information Systems (MIS) data (see database 164) is then updated to confirm that there was no communication error during the search process (step 617). Search results of this session are then cleared from the cache (step 619). myFareWatcher results display grid are shown to the user 301 (step 620). Search results display grid are also shown to the user 301 (step 621). The process then ends at step 622. The process of booking a flight will be further described with reference to FIGS. 7A-7D, which represents a single flowchart. As shown in FIG. 7A, the user 301 is presented with two possible search forms, a Quick Search form 703, and an Advanced Search form 702. The system then checks if the user correctly filled out all the fields in the form 703 or 702 (step 705). If he has not, an error message is shown (step 704) and the appropriate form 703 or 702 is redisplayed. If he has correctly filled out all the fields in the form 703 or 702, the system then checks if the destination code in the form is an airport code (step 706). If it is not, then alternative airport codes are provided to the user, and the user is requested to select an appropriate airport code (step 707). The form 703 or 702 is then redisplayed to the user 301. If the destination code is an airport code, the holding page is displayed to the user 301 (step 708). The search criteria are then saved into MIS tables, for use by myFareWatcher 124, and for error logging (step 709). In the next step, the system checks if this is a search for availability of a single private fare (step 710). If it is, then Galileo GDS 207 database 160 is queried for availability of the flight, as specified by the private fare (step 711). If the flight is available (step 713) then the discounter is queried to see if there are any applicable discounts (step 727). If it is not, then the system queries whether this is a search for a single airline or frequent flyer program (step 712). If it is not, then Galileo GDS 207 is questioned using Super BB (Super Best Buy) for all airlines, using preferences specified in the search criteria by the user 301 (step 714). If it is not, then Galileo GDS 207 is queried for a carrier specific search (step 715). The system then checks if there were any connection errors (step 716). If there were not, the system proceeds to step 718, checking whether the user 301 has specified a flexible date range (step 717) (if there is a connection error in step 716, then the system indicates a section connection error), and results of the search are cached, and tagged with a session ID (step 732). If the user 301 has specified a flexible date range in step 718, then the system checks whether a maximum date range has been reached (step 719). If it has, then search dates in the database are incremented (step 720), and the process returns to step 712. If the maximum date range has not been reached, then all results for old dates, including the search just performed, are merged (step 721). The system then proceeds to step 722, which gets the lowest found fare, and removes all results that are more expensive than a certain percentage of the lowest fare, for example, 30% more expensive (step 722). Also, in step 718, if the user has not specified a flexible range, the system proceeds directly to step 722. Following step 722, the Private Fares database 165 is queried for fares that are lower than or equal to the lowest fare supplied by Galileo GDS 207 (step 723). The system then checks if any private fares have been found that match the criteria (step 724). If yes, availability of the private fare is checked through Galileo GDS 207, and any fares that are unavailable are removed (step 725). Available private fares are merged with the results from previous searches of Galileo GDS 207 (step 726). The discounter 117 is then queried as described in step 727 above. If, in step 724, no private fares have been found, the system proceeds directly to step 727. Following step 727, the system checks if there are any applicable discounts for this route (step 728). If there are, then the discounts are applied to the fares that match the discounters criteria (step 730). If there are no applicable discounts, then myFareWatcher database 161 is updated with the lowest fare found on the search, together with the journey information (step 729). The system then checks whether the result triggers an alert service (robot 133) of myFareWatcher for other users (step 729). If it does not come up then the system proceeds to step 732, caching and tagging the results. If it does, then the myFareWatcher alert service (robot 133) is updated, which will result in the sending out of emails to appropriate users informing them of the found fare (step 733). This is typically done once a day, for example, at midnight. The system then proceeds to step 732, as described above. Following the caching and tagging of the result in step 732, the holding page is hidden, and the user 301 is moved to a page that displays the search results (step 734). Search results are retrieved from the cache using the session ID and the cache is cleared (step 735), while the system then checks if there is a connection error (step 736). If yes, then the user 301 is informed that there was a connection error (step 737), and the process ends (step 744). Otherwise, the myFareWatcher database 161 is queried for fares and dates previously found for this route, and which are lower than the lowest found fare. Normally, the dates applicable for the fare search are within one month of the user requested date range (step 738). The system then checks if any appropriate fares are found in the myFareWatcher database 161 (step 739). If yes, then the fares are bound to the myFareWatcher grid on a form that displays search results, and the panel is set to &#x201c;visible&#x201d; (step 740). The system then checks if this is a single private fare search (step 741). In step 739 if no fares have been found, then the system proceeds directly to step 741. If, in step 741, this was a single private fare search, then the system checks if the private fare is available (step 747). If not, then a message is added above the search result indicating that the private fare was not found, and that the displayed results represent alternatives (step 748). The system then checks if there are any available results (step 742). In step 747, if the private fares are available, then the system proceeds directly to step 742. If no results are available in step 742, then the user is informed accordingly, and the process terminates (step 744). If there are available results in step 742, then the results are bound to the display grid, and the grid is made visible (step 745). The results are then rendered and displayed as a web page to the user 301 (step 746). The user 301 then selects a desired search result (step 749). The result is then designated as the session &#x201c;post data&#x201d; (step 760). The user 301 is then redirected to a passenger information booking form (step 761). The system checks if the user 301 is already logged in (step 762). If he is not, then a login form 764 is displayed. If he is already logged in, then the form 764 is repopulated with user details (step 763). Once the data is in the form 764, the system checks if all the fields in the form 764 have been validly completed (step 765). If all the fields have not been validly completed, then an error message is shown (step 766), and the form 764 is redisplayed. If all the fields have been validly completed, then the user is asked to agree to the terms and conditions (step 767). If he has not agreed, then an error messages (step 766) is displayed. If he has agreed, then the session continues with the passenger names and details provided by the user (step 768). The user is redirected to a payment page (step 769). The session post data for the selected result and passenger information is retrieved (step 770). The system then checks if the currency of the fare is in U.S. dollars (step 771). If not, then a local currency equivalent is calculated (step 772). If it is, then the process proceeds directly to calculating a deposit fare, which is equal to, for example, 10% of the amount of the fare (step 773). The system then checks if the deposit fare is lower than a certain amount, for example, twenty dollars (step 774). If the amount is less than twenty dollars, then the deposit is set to twenty dollars (step 775). If it is not less than twenty dollars, then the deposit is set to some predetermined amount, for example, 10% of the value of the fare. The total fare amount and the deposit fare amount is then stored as the session amount (step 777). The system then checks if this is a private fare (step 778). If it is not a private fare, then the journey information is passed to the PMS to check which airline gets this fare for fulfillment (step 779). Next, the system checks whether an airline will be fulfilling this fare (step 782). If yes, then the details of the airline profile are received from the PMS (step 783). The system then gets to delivery options of the assigned agent based on the point of origin of this fare (step 784). In step 778, if the fare is a private fare, then the details are received from the PMS 112 regarding the agent/airline profile, as well as who owns this private fare and who will be fulfilling it (step 780). The process then proceeds to step 784. In step 782, if an airline will not be fulfilling this fare, then the system gets the details of the default fulfillment agent for this fare, based on the point of origin (step 781), and then proceeds to step 784. Following step 784, payment options and delivery options are displayed on the screen for the user (step 785). The system then checks if the user is logged in (step 786). If he is not, then log in form 787 is displayed. If he is logged in, then the form 787 is pre-populated with user details (step 788). Once the user fills out the form 787, the system checks if all the fields in the form are valid (step 790). If all the fields are not valid, then an error message is shown (step 789), and the form 787 is displayed again. If all the fields in form 787 are valid, then a payment holding page is displayed (step 791). The system then gets the currency regional information from the PMS 112 for use with TrustMarque (step 792). Credit card number and other user data is then received and checked for risk associated with a transaction (step 793). The system then checks if the risk is acceptable (step 794). If the risk is not acceptable, then an error message is shown (step 795) and the process terminates (step 744). If the risk is acceptable, then the payment is processed for the amount that the user has selected (which may be either the deposit amount or the full amount) (step 796). The system then verifies that the transaction has been approved (step 797). If the transaction has not been approved, then an error message returned by TrustMarque is displayed to the user, and another credit card number is requested (step 798). If the transaction is approved, then, using the Business Logic Layer 102, the system connects to Galileo GDS 207 and creates a PNR (step 799A). The system then checks if there was a connection error, or if seats are no longer available (step 799B). If either of those conditions are satisfied, then an error message is displayed to the user (step 799C), and the process terminates in step 744. If neither of those conditions are satisfied, then the system saves the PNR from Galileo GDS 207 and all the information related to the transaction (step 799D). A confirmation email is sent to the agent and the customer (step 799E). The holding page is then removed from the customer screen (step 799F). The PMS 112 is then queried for any opportunities to cross sell packages that match the journey criteria (step 799G). The user is then redirected to a &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; page (in other words a confirmation page), while all the data from this session is used to create the confirmation page (step 799H). The &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; page is displayed, with cross selling options for, e.g., packages, hotels, and cars (step 799I). The process then terminates at step 744. The approach described above provides a number of benefits. For example, time to market of the software is reduced from two weeks to maximum of five days. Complete control over all technical environments is enabled. A modularized approach makes modifications easy to achieve. A componentized approach enables &#x201c;plug and play&#x201d; with different websites. Also, full first, second and third level support is available to all of the agents.
